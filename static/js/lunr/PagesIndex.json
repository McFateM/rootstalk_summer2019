contains one of the most crucial shorebird stopping places in the western hemisphere Each spring tiny western sandpipers weighing only 08 to 12 ounces leave their winter homes in the south to fly from 900 to 2500 miles to reach their Alaskan breeding grounds These diminutive sandpipers must be able to find areas of marsh swamp or beach where they can rest and store body fat to accomplish their marathon migration If the birds are unable to find enough food in one spot they will be forced to stop again Too much delay will cause the birds to arrive late to their summer breeding grounds If too much of the short Arctic summer has been wasted some of the birds may choose not to mate Since the United States contains only three large shorebird stopping places east of the Rockies Cheyenne Bottoms is clearly indispensable If you visit Cheyenne Bottoms in late October or early November in addition to seeing many ducks geese and various shorebirds you might be lucky enough to spot an endangered whooping crane In 1941 these tall white cranes numbered only sixteen Now there are nearly 300 partly thanks to safe havens like Cheyenne Bottoms Other protected or endangered species that visit the marsh are the bald eagle piping plover and peregrine falcon The wetlands have been designated as a critical habitat for both whooping cranes and the interior least tern figure

as the Cheyenne after whom Cheyenne Bottoms is named knew of this place Although other explorers visited the region and large numbers of settlers began arriving in Kansas by 1854 it was not until the 1920s that anyone felt moved to find out more about the thousands of birds that arrived at the Bottoms each year Frank W Robl a farmer from the Ellinwood area began banding birds at Cheyenne in 1924 He caught birds with nets or traps that would not harm them Once a bird was caught he secured a small metal band containing his contact information around one of the birds legs He hoped someone maybe a hunter would recover the bird and return the band to him so he could determine how far the banded birds had journeyed Robl found that the birds hed banded at Cheyenne Bottoms had flown to Kansas from all over North America pullquote Kansas contains one of the most crucial shorebird stopping places in the western hemisphere pullquote Robl was astonished at the returns he collected receiving them from as far away as Alaska South Carolina and California while other birds were recovered in Mexico and Honduras Beside satisfying his own curiosity Robls work served another purpose He spoke at the State Wildlife Conference about preserving Cheyenne Bottoms for migrating birds and when he was offered a few minutes on a national radio program in 1934 he told a million people about the marsh Others who were interested in creating a wildlife refuge at Cheyenne joined with Robl to testify before the Senate Committee on Wildlife and he even contacted thenVice President Charles Curtis In response to these efforts Congress promised 350000 for construction of dikes roads and hunting blinds for sportsmen so Cheyenne Bottoms could be properly managed However because of the Depression only 50000 were made available Despite this setback Robls dedicated banding of nearly 19000 birds over a quarter of a century showed the world how important Cheyenne Bottoms was and helped protect the wetlands for many more generations of birds In 1966 Edmund Martinez became interested in banding the birds of Cheyenne Bottoms Since Robl had banded very few shorebirds when Martinez began banding birds only 349 shorebirds had been banded in all North America Over the next twelve years Martinez banded over 58000 birds from 32 species His northernmost return came from Siberia and his southernmost from Argentina A 1974 shorebird survey in which Martinez participated found that no other place from Texas to North Dakota had even ten percent the number of shorebirds that visited

Archival Inkjet Print each image 36 x 54 inches by Regan Golden 2015 For the past decade my artwork and research has focused on edgelands from a forest in Massachusetts bordering a subdivision to a ragged prairie in Minnesota running along a railyard Edgelands act like scrims rendering other spaces invisible yet the edgelands are absent from most city maps This wavering visibility seeps into my photographs and drawings the soft villous hairs on the unfurling fern fronds are partially obscured by a puddle of green paint Edgelands are considered one of the last refuges of wildness I photograph and draw the plants I discover in these overgrown patches of weeds as the seasons change My images are as much about making visible this overlooked landscape as they are about documenting the passage of time The Prairie Constructs are an ongoing series which catalogs the life and death of plants from the edgelands of Minneapolis Made almost entirely on the scanner bed The Prairie Constructs are a digital version of a photogram or botanical solar print The images are shown as both largescale digital color prints and as an artist book or compendium showing the evolution in the landscape over the course of a year What started as a way of collecting bits and pieces of plants as the seasons change has turned into a methodical and sometimes frenetic project of gathering and experimenting with each plant Since I often uncover synthetic materials plastic bags mostly as I collect plants I included these in the images as well Chance also plays an important role because the view from below of the scanner is not visible until the image appears on my screen I place my materials within the frame and then document them as they react and evolve melt flow crumple wilt often making multiple scans from a single combination of paint photographs plants and plastics I orchestrate this organic process that is then recorded and amplified through digital technology Light is an important ingredient in the transformation of my materials and in the elevation of these spaces I work with light when photographing the landscape making the scans and installing the images In traditional landscape painting light can be interpreted as lumen observed light or lux divine light or the light of reason I prefer to think about light in terms of Heideggers description of lichtung which translates as light in a forest clearing He argues that openness must precede lumen and lux observation and judgment My work enables me to be open to the natural world that is around me even in the city It is this sense of wonder and awareness about the persistence of urban nature that I want to pass on to viewers through my images figure srcimagesvolumevissue1closeupregangoldenregangolden02jpg captionPrairie Construct

experts on roots and energy They know how much energy is needed to extract roots how much energy is needed to stay uprooted and because a state of uprootedness is unsustainable over the long run how much to sink roots deep into the ground again I remember standing in North Dakota and looking toward the horizon One can actually see Earth as a globe the slight curve of the horizon where the winds come from that bend the grass and the few trees and where the clouds gather that sweep overhead only to disappear again and make way for the blue sky Sometimes looking toward the horizon I would feel an overwhelming joy seeing mountains in the distance It was usually a short emotion as I realized that my mind had played tricks Those were not mountains could not be mountains They were clouds that had swept me away toward home mirroring a more familiar landscape figure srcimagesvolumevissue1extractionrootsenergyplainsextraction01jpg captionAll photos courtesy Sebastian Braun Living on the Great Plains costs a lot of energy The sky overhead is endless and the people are exposed to that sky as if on a plate Shelter becomes more than a physical necessity Humility in the face of this force is selfimposing and sometimes overpowering There is a connection between people and nature because everybody is exposed to forces that cannot be tamed or understood At least that is until people started to surround themselves with constant shelter as if to avoid having to look into that sky to acknowledge the force to be humble Instead they could now disconnect themselves from nature think of themselves as superior and think of distance in miles per hour hurtling themselves quicker and quicker through the landscape they no longer needed to acknowledge ripping up all their roots at least the long deep strong roots that hold the grasses in place against the winds Instead they now plowed the earth and selected what roots were allowed to grow And all of this cost even more energy because to be without roots requires one to levitate in place nothing but a fleeting shadow over the land which has become but an abstraction no longer real because it is just land There is no distinct smell of the earth no change in winds that herald rain no experience of seasonality no need to observe closely how its other inhabitants behave no sharing of the landscape with them Kinship and its obligations have been narrowed to the people in the shelter and has been turned against those outside the shelter And so with the extraction of roots comes the need to extract more and more energy Energy has become visualized for me in the form of long trains of black tank cars and coal tenders moving across the plains When we lived in North Dakota they were parked right next to the campus of the university where I taught and I often wondered what would happen if the oil wagons exploded like they had done in Lac MegantiquehttpsenwikipediaorgwikiLacMC3A9ganticraildisaster and right outside Casselton Now that I live in Iowa the same wagons rumble by our house about five times a week Here they are loaded with ethanol not oil or coal but the image of energy being transported to markets is the same The PrairiePlains are the heart that sends fuel to the outliers It is a restless procession of long trains traveling through places that try to still be rooted yet are more and more depopulated People and grass have been uprooted and swept away and even those who have stayed behind need heavy machinery to anchor them down now that the roots are mostly gone and the shelterbelts are disappearing There are other ways that the energy flows of course Pipelines cross the Plains like a vast network of pulsating arteries Not veins however as there is not much coming back Invisible those lines are connected to the new artificial roots of hydraulic fracturing These roots fan out from wells which draw different nutrients out of the Earth nutrients for the industrialized society However just like the roots of waterhungry plants these new kinds of roots are also thirsty They are thirsty for poisonous nutrients"},{"title":"A Child's First Taste of

Casualty","href":"/healing-the-smallest-casualty","type":"Personal essay","author":"Randall Hotchkin","content":"We arrived in Iraq under the cover of darkness We were a large deployment group from Wilford Hall Medical Center Lackland Air Force Base San Antonio Texas Many of us knew each other but to say we were well acquainted would be a stretch After all Wilford Hall was the largest medical facility in the Air Force The range of relationships prior to our deployment was all over the map much like the range of backgrounds and hometowns that make up every military unit Wed been trained and trained well but would that be enough How would we perform in a high tempo mass casualty environment It was August 2004 and we were entering a war zone specifically Operation Iraqi Freedom We were assigned to the 332nd Expeditionary Medical Squadron located on Balad Air BasehttpsenwikipediaorgwikiBaladAirBase forty miles north of Baghdad We had every function of a civilian hospital including surgical capability radiology pharmacy supply logistics and so on all housed under rows of canvas tents connected by one long main hallway Each tent that extended perpendicularly from the hallway housed a different section of the hospital I was assigned to the MedicalSurgical Ward which was actually housed in three of these tents Iraq was very different from the small Iowa town where I was raised right down to the very soil Iowa is known for its fertile fields while the soil in Iraq more closely resembled baby powder with a slightly tan tint to it In fact everything in Iraq had a tan tint to it the sand the tents our uniforms everything The lush green rows of crops that grow in my home state were nowhere to be seen there Throughout my training Id tried to prepare myself for the wounded American and coalition forces that we might care for What was surprising were the number of civilian and quite possibly enemy combatants that we would be expected to treat And it was these patients that we would see for much longer periods of time Aeromedical evacuation or aerovac was so efficient that we rarely saw the same American casualties for more than a shift or two More often than not wed return for our next shift hoping to check on the status of a patient only to discover that they had been Aerovaccd out to Germany or even stateside It was one of these Iraqi patients who would steal our hearts and become a ray of light in the darkness His name was Sajad and he was already a resident of the hospital when we arrived We guessed he was somewhere around four years old but no one knew for sure An Army patrol had found him in a local village His leg had been badly burned and had healed in a flexed position making it impossible to straighten No one knew how or when his injury had taken place but what was certain was that this little guy would never walk again without surgical intervention Even with cultural and religious barriers it was communicated to the boys family that our facility could help and they consented He began a series of surgeries where the scar tissue that bound his leg was cut away and replaced with layers of skin from his little back Im not sure how many surgeries he had endured prior our arrival but he had not yet walked We all enjoyed caring for Sajad When he was coming out of anesthesia following one of his procedures wed hold him until he awoke and was reacquainted with his surroundings I doubt that Id take to the diet most Iraqis live on but I do believe Sajad was quite pleased with what he tasted of ours especially candy He would devour anything put in front of him and there were plenty of care packages to share Im not sure Id ever seen a belly swell like his did after one of his binge sessions This as you might expect led to the least enjoyable aspect of caring for Sajad as he was still dependent on diapers We finally had to hang a sign above his bed stating in large block letters PLEASE DO NOT FEED THE CHILD After each surgical procedure Sajads leg would be in a hard cast or some sort of splint to keep it immobilized Walking with a bent leg was impossible but teaching him to walk with straight stiff leg was going to be a challenge Someone found one of those round baby walkers with wheels that he could sit in and this worked amazingly well Sajad was off and running It meant he required much more supervision but it was a joy to see a child play especially in the environment we were surrounded by We couldnt help but wonder whether this was his first time experiencing this kind of freedom We worked on weening him away from the walker We would often stand him up and toss a soccer ball at him Prompting him to kick it back This was quite effective at working on his balance and agility I definitely knew that many of those I was serving with were extremely fond of little Sajad Who could blame them He was as cute as could be He smiled constantly and rarely fussed One of the fondest memories I have was one of those moments when you hear a new word or words from a youngster and know he or she understands the proper use of that vocabulary Obviously there was a language barrier between us but one day I was holding Sajad and out of nowhere he gave me a big hug smiled and said I love you My heart absolutely melted We all wanted to see him progress but I dont think we correlated this with him leaving us After all hed been with us for the majority of our deployment It only seemed logical that wed be able to keep him Sajads family had only visited a few times in the more than two months hed been with us We often wondered if theyd abandoned him I was so convinced of this and was certainly so attached that I actually had my First Sergeant contact the US Embassy on my behalf to look into my adopting Sajad They made it clear that that scenario was not possible I now believe that his family probably had transportation or financial obstacles that kept them away Our feelings for Sajad were never clearer than they were on the day we learned his family was picking him up Word spread through the hospital like a wildfire I rushed to his bed as soon as I heard There was a group of around halfadozen medical personnel there which was about halfadozen more than were needed but we all wanted to say goodbye The mood that followed was worse than anything wed experienced to date and wed experienced a lot Wed set records for the number of casualties aerovacd out of the area of operation so you can imagine the level of carnage wed been exposed to Our affection for our little mascot was clear and became even clearer a few weeks later when Sajad returned for a followup Again the news flew through the facility and again I raced to find him When I located him he was surrounded by staff members and of course eating When our eyes met he lit up and his big smile met mine Theres one memory in particular that connects the life I led in Iraq with the life I am leading today in my home town I was one of the higherranking personnel in the hospital and functioned as a shift supervisor Those who worked for me had specific patients to care for and duties assigned to them I had much more flexibility which allowed me to spend more time with Sajad and Id often carry him with me as I made my rounds One day I noticed his hair was getting a little shaggy and decided a haircut was in order As you might imagine this mission had a high chance of failure After all no one can predict how a child will behave in a barber chair and thats without a language barrier Sajad seemed to trust me I guess wed bonded pretty well by this point but honestly Im sure he was ready for a change of scenery So I loaded him up in the Hummvee buckled him in the passenger seat and we were off to the barbershop I dont remember now if he gave me much trouble in the barber chair but I do remember holding him in my lap as the barber did his thing and I remember working up quite a sweat doing it He was sure a hit with everyone we encountered that afternoon Smiling and greeting them all bringing a smile to their faces as well He certainly looked sharp with that new cut and it seemed he knew it as well figure captionPhoto courtesy of Randall Hotchkin srcimagesrjsbarbershopjpg Its interesting to note that many years later retired from the Air Force I find myself back in my hometown cutting hair in my own smalltown barbershop I had a friend once tell me that she thought it was really cool that I had joined the military like my father and was now doing hair like my mother who was a beautician Im fine with where things ended up There arent many things you can do in life that give you immediate gratification from your work but I have that privilege There are probably many things that shape a man and who he will become I like to think we had a variety of missions while in Iraq but most important to me was the healing of hearts and minds Hopefully little Sajad will never don a suicide vest or detonate a vehicle born IED Improvised Explosive Device Hopefully he shares his memories with friends and family of the nice Americans that made it possible for him to walk In a perfect world I imagine him as a community or national leader working to erase the hatred that seems so prevalent in his culture These days I get to turn folks of all ages around to unveil their new haircut and see their initial response Fortunately that response is usually positive Many times the customer is a young boy who cant hide the pride he feels in how he looks Much like little Sajad on our barbershop adventure that sunny day in Iraq"},{"title":"Jumping Into the Void","href":"/jumping-into-the-void","type":"Interview","author":"Matt and  Sarah

Iowa owned by the Consolidation Coal Co of Chicago The town that grew up around the mine Buxton2 near present day Albia was named eponymously for its manager Ben C Buxton That was where my greatgrandparents Ross and Blanche Johnson arrived from Virginia in 1895 Why did they travel so far To understand why my grandparents and other African Americans perceived Iowa as a place of refuge we have to understand the conditions they endured in 1890s Virginia In the year 1894 African Americans were actually the majority of the population of Albemarle County Virginia The county was home to 606 free Blacks and 13916 enslaved African Americans compared to 12103 Whites Of course fear of that Black majority engendered the kinds of naked oppression you might expect from those dedicated to maintaining White supremacy by any means necessary Segregation was the rule in every area of Charlottesville public life Ross Johnson my greatgrandfather was well aware of social vocational and economic lines that could or could not be crossed Even a casual review of what my ancestors endured in Jim Crow Virginia serves to underline the hope and possibility that buoyed them on their journey out of the South During the Civil War Iowa had been on the Union side of things thank goodness and so this land was blessed with a somewhat more progressive humanistic perspective than say Missouri or the states that had been in the Confederacy So Ross and Blanch Porter Johnson left Charlottesville in 1893 for coal mining work on the Iowa prairie My grandmother Lettie Porter Thompson was born in Monroe County on November 19 1896 As a child in Iowa Lettie experienced a totally different social matrix than the one she wouldve endured in Charlottesville That is not to say her family members didnt experience reduced opportunities because of their skin color but life was materially better in Iowa if for no other reason than that they were able to take advantage of social and educational opportunities denied them in the South That my Grandmother could proudly say of her Iowa childhood we didnt know nothin bout no segregation meant that something very significant had occurred With a

last Spring to give a comprehensive talk about some of her findings During her presentation she debunked many of the myths we as consumers embrace concerning how healthy and safe the local foods movement really is Farming is an incredibly strenuous occupation and unfortunately many of the economic physical and mental stressors farmers endure are not acknowledged by the very people consuming the fruits of their labor In order to fully understand the labor that goes into bringing crop from farm to table it is imperative that we learn about what goes on behind the scenes Janssen goes into detail about the process of accessing labor how farmer and farmers market relationships work and the alarming ways in which agricultural labor puts farmers at high risk for mental and emotional

Town","href":"/the-hottest-car-in-town","type":"Memoir","author":"Allan Moyer","content":"Hotrods The pastime of cruising your pride and joy down Main Street racing to impress the hometown crowd is a lost art of a long gone era in Grinnell Iowa High Octane Beginnings I lived in the country and graduated from the eighth grade at Ewart School I then moved to Grinnell with my folks A secondhand bicycle was the incentive to attend high school Before I ever got my license I drove with my parents to Seven Mile Corner and a patrolman came along and stopped us He said I was a good driver but I was too short and of course had no license He gave me a five dollar fine which my father paid In 1945 five dollars was quite a bit of money When I finally got my license I was restricted to sitting on a pillow when I drove During high school I bought a motorbike which would reach upwards of 50 mph but I didnt get my first hot car until I graduated in 1948 a 1932 Model B Ford black I had to pay for the car myself Once outta high school I worked at Central Meat Market for 30 a week cutting meat and thats how I paid for it The Ford had a V8 engine and spare wheels in each of the front fenders At that time it was one of the fastest cars in Grinnell and I thought it was real cool Back then everybody would be downtown just messing around The girls would walk the block and the boys would scoop the loop driving real slow to show off their cars We used to race anyone we could those nights This was after people got done with work because you see everybody worked back then Youd see somebody pull up beside them and then ask if theyd wanna race Chances were the other guy would be driving the other way and youd just stop in the middle of the road and decide where youd race to Then youd go out to the edge of town line up and take off ending at Seven Mile Corner on the other edge of town The Seven Mile Corner was the intersection of Highway 63 to Tama and Route Six to Malcom a local landmark The girls were young and silly and theyd always be two or three together Youd always have buddies in the car with you It was never a oneonone thing My friends would be rooting for me in the back of the car We lost very few races in town Hot Hand I think we only had around three or four police then The chief at the time was Glen Bell I knew two of the local police pretty well They drove Pontiacs and always rode two in a car around town Once in a while they would even play ditchum with us with them chasing us around but more often than not we would end up losing them Caution do not try this at home kids One officer lived two blocks down from me he seemed big and intimidating back then But he was about as close to being a buddy and as friendly as you could get at least for a police officer He knew what I did with my car One time he caught me as I was racing my friend Jerry from this little hamburger joint over where Lincoln Bank is now and up Sixth Avenue He caught me right about where the new library is Jerrys dad had just got a new Oldsmobile And the cop teased Youve got a pretty poor car to be racing that new Oldsmobile and I said Well I bet I could take you And so we raced out to Seven Mile Corner They couldnt go all the way out of town but theyd go out at least threequarters of a mile out of town to Langs Dairy Oh I beat them a coupla times The officer wouldnt really say anything when Id win Makes sense since if word got out they were racin theyd probably be in big trouble All he knew was that I had the hottest car in town Unfortunately the hottest car in town eventually came to an end The car was light in the rearend which made it possible to slide it around corners fast without upsetting however the car had one big drawback it was very hard on transmissions You had to replace the transmissions at least half a dozen times so it got to be almost second nature Transmissions cost five dollars That was a lot of money for back then as Ive already said Youd have to go to the junkyard to get a replacement It had to be a Ford transmission Fortunately the local junkyard kept me in good supply A friend and I could change one out in two to three hours Old Sam Berman ran the junkyard I knew him real well and hed chatter like a chipmunk but he knew what I wanted when I came He didnt give me no discount just wanted his five dollars Hed have probably let me have it on credit though if I asked The junkyard used to be over where the Fareway food store is now near a warehouse for Meadow Gold ice cream where they loaded into and out of trucks The junkyard would buy old cars iron and metal scraps even animal hides Back then they moved it all by hand or with trucks now theyve got big cranes After two years the front frame finally broke and I had to junk my beloved car out The body ended up in my brotherinlaws hog lot Truly a sorry end to my first car However I didnt lose my love for speed and danger as I raced a stock car over at the Newton Iowarace track for two seasons High Stakes Back in the day wed race out in Newton where they had a fifthofamile track I raced my friends Chevy for him It cost money to enter They had prize money and they charged people to come and watch It used to be a pretty big deal over a hundred people would be in the bleachers on every Saturday night Wed work on it all day Saturday and then that night go and race Wed fixed it back up again Sunday so itd run Eddie Anderson who had a body shop in Grinnell even raced in big time races like the one at the State Fair with actual race cars I never did win much and I even rolled my car once but it was a lotta fun back then and a lotta folks did it A Family Affair My mom took my car to go visit a friend once Since those hot cars had manual brakes you had to use your head and know whats ahead of you It didnt have no hydraulic pressure so it was almost as good as just dragging your foot to stop Youd burn rubber taking off but you couldnt really stop it Well she backed out of the driveway and before she knew it she was halfway across the railroad tracks She never asked to borrow my car again after that The engine was also pretty loud Youd take the muffler off and stick a straight pipe on it but the cops didnt like that"},{"title":"Two Poems","href":"/two-poems-john-grey","type":"Poetry","author":"John Grey","content":" Feeling Autumnal Once brash colors curl up die drift one by one to earth Light shrinks wind whips clear the last of warmth The sky is as gray as granite Lake surface wrinkles like skin flinches Geese and ducks rock in

middleaged but I head for home before things really darken Dissatisfaction This winter has provided all of its promised textures white and overspreading as lovely in an ascetic way as pale cheeks in a mirror But its bitterness plunges daggers its winds are as brutal as they are predictable And this standstill is another word for loneliness But theres the warmth of the fire a gathering with others that begins as necessity but matures into closeness I hate to see it leave But spring is like a child in winters womb Im so in thrall to its coming But what if its a monster Each morning the calendar turns over The temperature is up or down The feelings run the gamut I so love this weather I cant wait until it changes Or theres a new mood to the air So whats wrong with the old one But mostly I

Greyhound take a puddlejumper to Red Deer or Regina Moncton or Trois Riviers Never made it past Ohio Indiana save for the occasional foray to Seattle And now too old landlocked in these dreams and living in a California desert lost among brown burning hills I long still for northern nights basso winds tinged with frost fenceposts that dress up on Sundays in their best winter hats of snow I

Moyer","content":"I have been blessed to live in the country all my life To see the sun set in a blaze of glory orange pink and red to smell the new mown hay to hear the first frogs croak in the springall are treasures The decision to share this wonder began when a preschool teacher in Newton was looking for a farm to bring their children to visit It was the beginning of years of fun At our farm we milked cows raised feeder pigs and had beef cattle Before the present ideas of safe food we served milk straight from the big stainless steel cooler and deviled eggs from our hens Gathering eggs was the kids favorite We cautioned them not to reach under setting hens One little boy stood too close to the nests and was pecked on his nose He cried and cried and he probably hates chickens now Bottle feeding baby calves goats or lambs was also a fun challenge for teachers and children There were baby animals of every kind to hold chicks ducks kittens and rabbits With chicks hatching there was shredded paper to jump and play in Carrots or apples were offered as treats for the donkey deer and llama We even had an unfriendly emu Peacocks entertained with their large beautiful tails spread as they strutted about There were quail too Weiner roasts or snack lunches were enjoyed down in the timber which was reached by hayride The ride was pulled by tractor or a team of two big black Percheron horses A typical wooden outhouse was provided in the timber with mixed reactions The girls were reluctant to venture in Spiders you know The boys on the other hand loved it and tried to peek through cracks when the girls went in Walks through the hickory and oak trees followed lunch with flower picking among the birds hawks soaring above and chipmunks scurrying to hide Exploring crawdad mud volcanoes by the stream was especially fun On one occasion in the timber the neighbors bull had appeared on our side of the fence The teacher and I were driving him back while a high school boy remained with us He stayed behind us shouting Im behind you Ive got your backs Yeah right we both thought but the moral support was appreciated We typically divided the children into three groups one rode ponies one gathered eggs and the other group fed animals and went to the hay mow in the barn Pony rides were complete with cowboy music and no lines to wait in except for the rides Children would not go play on the big hay bales for fear of missing their ride figure captionChickhatching time at the Moyers farm always meant there was shredded paper for visiting kids to jump in srcimagesvolumevissue1welcomingtheworldtoourfarmplayinginpaperjpg Two geese roamed the barnyard Two grandmothers brought their very little granddaughters to see the animals They had known my husband for a long time and they visited as we toured One of the geese grabbed the littlest girl by the seat of her pants and would not let go I was frantically trying to reassure her while the adults were laughing and taking pictures of her When we see them now they all still laugh about the goose story Handicapped adults and children were also visitors to the farm After visiting with the animals the children would often smile and try to talk to the delight of their teachers Animals were good therapy especially the ponies There was also a wedding a church service a square dance Christmas in the barn as well as performances by various music groups Before the holiday season the Rev David Brandt see A Place to Call Homeaplacetocallhome by Bridget Brandt also in this issue approached us with the idea of a Christmas Service in the barn We thought it was a great plan and moved forward removing all the kiddy things possible We made a pen for lambs a cage for a rooster and disguised a llama as a camel at the bottom of the ramp Weather was good and a few heaters made it comfortable The rooster crowed repeatedly through it all and that was what people remembered We enjoyed this for three years I believe but the last year it was very cold and that cold put an end to a nice part of our memories The wedding came about from a request from our granddaughter who wanted a Western wedding in the barn Her fianc had friends in Missouri who brought their horses and camped in the timber Their job was to park carsThe rehearsal dinner was a fancy chuckwagon dinner in the timber where the cowboys were camping Everything went well and the service was very nice The large crowd sat across the haymow and our friends sang all the wedding music accompanied by guitarsThe weather was perfect but when they walked down the ramp from the barn a large black cloud was in the westThe wedding party rode on our hayrack pulled by our black Percheron horses to the American Legion Post building across Highway 146 in Grinnell The brides parents and the cowboys rode horses and accompanied themThe local police stopped traffic at the corner for them to crossThe wedding party had a large umbrella which they ended up needing because it rained and poured all along the way Thankfully they were dry but Allan and I were soaked When we arrived at the Legion the electricity was off so we came home to get candles and leave the horses A buffet meal was in full swing when we returned and eventually the electricity came back on A memorable event to say the least Finally when Al Gore was a presidential hopeful there was almost a visit to the farm The whole family had background checks and the Secret Service arrived in black cars We were all quite impressed They checked everywhere for sniper hiding places even the attic in the house Unfortunately the final decision arrived when not enough telephone access could be available to accommodate their needs A big adventure anyway Occasionally we hear from a mom or dad who visited our place as a kindergartner and they tell us about how their kids also enjoyed a visit to the farm Many friends relatives and neighbors made this all possible and are fondly remembered by all our family We havent had school visits for many years now Almost all the animals have been sold off but there is still a donkey and a mule They just seem a part of the place And of course there are always cats milling around and hens in the chicken coop out back So many memories return when writing this story figure captionKittens in the Hay Mow

Of particular interest to me this past spring was Studio 6 the Arts Councils MondaythroughThursday after school program that attracts approximately 20 to 25 students The kids attending Studio 6 come from different backgrounds in the town and adult artistmentors guide them in working with one another to create pieces of art that reflect their cohesion as a classroom During the spring class I was involved in the Studio 6 kids worked on a myriad of art projects Sometimes they paved their own paths in personal individual projects sometimes they worked together to create something great and grand In response to this issues theme of community I decided to explore how the children of the Studio 6 classroom could represent their own definition of community in a mural I reached out to GAAC staff memberteachers Katie In and Alesia Lacina and told them I was interested in doing a project They excitedly agreed to spearhead a mural project where Studio 6 students would create an image that reflected what community meant to them Within weeks we created muralesque scenes on the classroom walls and unleashed the kids to create I went to two Studio 6 classes in which students produced two separate murals Both had similar initial prompts beginning with the depiction of large trees Before we started the project though I talked with the students to help guide what this mural would look like We prompted the students with questions like What do you think community is Interestingly the two classes differing concept of community was reflected in their answers discussions and later in the murals they created The first classs discussion emphasized sharing peace and caring for others The second classs mural centered on the kids ideas about who community members were and explored the theme of working together This group continually mentioned firefighters police officers and the idea of working together to make something Using images of the students work and quotes from their commentary on community as they worked Ive traced this project from its beginnings through the finished project figure captionKaitie Hess What Do You Think Community Is 01
