<p>Back  in  the  late  50s  and  early  60s,  there  was  a  cop show called &ldquo;Naked City&rdquo; on network TV. Each  episode  always  ended  with  a  narrator&rsquo;s  voice  in-toning the same line: &ldquo;There are eight million stories in the naked city. This has been one of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m  thinking  about  this  phrase&mdash;particularly  the  <em>eight  million  stories</em> part&mdash;as  I  assemble  the  essays  for  this  issue  of  <em>Rootstalk</em> which  community  members  in  Grinnell, Iowa, worked up with Jon Andelson, me and our  students  in  the  community  writing  workshop  we  convened  last  spring.  Our  workshop&rsquo;s  participants  included small-town politicians, a retired teacher, a social worker, a pair of retired farmers, a professional wood-worker, a coffee shop owner, and one of the town&rsquo;s barbers.  While  the  stories  they  produced  didn&rsquo;t  quite  add  up  to  eight  million,  they  were  striking  nonetheless  for  their variety, depth and poignancy. None of our work-shop  participants  were  professional  storytellers.  And  yet,  by  turns,  they  shared  passages  from  their  lives  that  were  funny,  touching,  and&mdash;to  use  a  word  that’s  much-overused these days&mdash;<em>diverse</em>. I was surprised.</p>

<p>As I think of it now, though, I shouldn’t have been. Having grown up myself in a town with fewer people in it than Grinnell’s 10,000, I know better than to sell my neighbors short. I guess I’m as guilty as the next person of putting my head down and focusing only on the next step rather than the landscape that’s opening up around me.</p>

<p>Sitting at the table with these people was not a little humbling. I&rsquo;d  known some of these folks for years, and I  figured  I  knew  them  pretty  well&mdash;well  enough,  anyway, to call them <em>neighbors</em> if not <em>friends</em>. And yet, many times  during  our  workshop,  in  response  to  something  one  of  the  participants  shared,  I  felt  like  saying:  <em>I  had  no idea&hellip;</em></p>

<p>I daresay I&rsquo;m not alone in this. Most of us are in a great hurry to do what we need to do to live our lives. We don&rsquo;t talk to each other&mdash;or if we do, too often we don&rsquo;t really <em>listen</em> to each other&mdash;because  (we  tell  ourselves) we don&rsquo;t have time. We&rsquo;ve got to get to work, got to fill our gas tank, got to pick up the kids from school, got to hustle home to fix dinner, got to tick off the items on our to-do list.</p>
