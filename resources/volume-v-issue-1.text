[S]{._idGenDropcap-1}[ome words---]{.CharOverride-1}[bank, government,
weather, gun]{.CharOverride-2}[---give off a decidedly ambivalent vibe.
It all depends. Others are more clearly
negative---]{.CharOverride-1}[pollution, debt,
cult]{.CharOverride-2}[---or positive---]{.CharOverride-1}[love, warmth,
faith]{.CharOverride-2}[. For me, the word community is in the
"positive" category. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[I ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[would rather not get into the
definition game; books have been written about it. Maybe we can get away
with saying, "you know community when you see it." In any event, for
most people, most of the time, community conjures thoughts and feelings
that are good, supportive, comfortable. Those who find it suffocating to
live in places where the person next door knows too much about them will
generally not complain about community; instead, their complaint will
center on small towns, on nosy neighbors, or on not having enough to do.
In fact, we often hear and read laments about the decline of community
feeling in the contemporary world. Most of us think it's good to live in
a place that has a community feel about it, whether that place is an
urban neighborhood, a rural church parish, or a village.
]{.CharOverride-1}

[R]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-2}[ootstalk]{.CharOverride-2}[ is a
publication of Grinnell College's Center for Prairie Studies
(]{.CharOverride-1}https://www.grinnell.edu/academics/centers-programs/prairie-studies[),
whose three guiding principles---as it says on our letterhead---are
]{.CharOverride-1}[community, sustainability, and
place]{.CharOverride-2}[. By definition then, we at
]{.CharOverride-1}[Rootstalk]{.CharOverride-2}[ are interested in
community---its meaning, its shape, and our ability to keep it healthy.
What experiences create a feeling of community? What goals can bring a
community together? What strains can divide a community? What role do
memory and tradition play in maintaining a community?]{.CharOverride-1}

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[his issue of
]{.CharOverride-1}[Rootstalk]{.CharOverride-2}[ offers several pieces of
content that address such questions. The short essays by Bridget Brandt,
Sam Cox, Randall Hotchkin, and Allan and Shirley Moyer in fact came out
of a writing workshop, centered on defining community, which we held
last spring as part of a class at Grinnell College co-taught by
]{.CharOverride-1}[Rootstalk's]{.CharOverride-2}[ editor, Mark Baechtel,
and myself. The students in our class first took their own writing
workshop, facilitated by noted northeast Iowa writer and publisher,
Robert Wolf (whose new book, ]{.CharOverride-1}[Building the
Agricultural City: A Handbook for Rural Renewal
]{.CharOverride-2}[(]{.CharOverride-1}http://www.robertwolfthewriter.com/books/building-the-agricultural-city[),
]{.CharOverride-1}[is reviewed in this issue by Fred Kirschenmann). Bob,
who has led writing workshops around the country, had each student share
a personal story with the class. These oral stories became the basis for
writing, as Bob coached each student in finding their voice and creating
an engaging narrative structure. Next, we invited residents from the
town of Grinnell (]{.CharOverride-1}https://www.grinnelliowa.gov, [where
Grinnell College is located) to participate in the class for several
sessions. Each community member was paired with a student, whose task it
was to help them in the way Bob had helped the students. The stories
that came out of these sessions provide glimpses of the community
feeling in Grinnell. We decided to include in this set a photo essay by
one of the students in the class, Katie Hess, as it deals with an
after-school arts program in Grinnell.]{.CharOverride-1}

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[here are other content-pieces in
this issue which deal with community. An essay from Mary Kay Shanley
(]{.CharOverride-1}http://www.marykayshanley.com[) explores the
evolution of newspaper obituaries as an expression of community life.
Joshua Lockyer
(]{.CharOverride-1}https://www.atu.edu/profiles.php?name=jlockyer&menu=behaviorsci[)
tells us about the Dancing Rabbit Ecovillage
(]{.CharOverride-1}https://www.dancingrabbit.org[) in northeast
Missouri---an intentionally-formed community whose residents are
transforming a piece of former farmland into a space where they can
collectively realize a new vision of society, in the process finding
ways to dramatically shrink their collective carbon footprint. An
autobiographical essay from Dartanyan Brown
(]{.CharOverride-1}https://www.dartanyan.com/About\_Me.html[) begins in
the Mahaska County, Iowa, coal mining town of Buxton
(]{.CharOverride-1}https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buxton\_Historic\_Townsite[),
a racially integrated community where his grandmother was born. Her
experience there shaped Dartanyan's sense of community throughout his
life. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[N]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ot all of the content in the
fall issue deals with community, but---as usual---all of it deals with
life in the prairie region, which we like to think of as a wider
community of readers. We hope you enjoy everything in the issue, and we
hope that what you see here provokes you to frame your own thoughts
about what it means to live in concert with other humans. Let us hear

[B]{._idGenDropcap-1}[ack in the late 50s and early 60s, there was a cop
show called \"Naked City\" on network TV. Each episode always ended with
a narrator\'s voice intoning the same line: \"There are eight million
stories in the naked city. This has been one of
them.\"]{.CharOverride-1}

[I]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[\'m thinking about this
phrase---particularly the ]{.CharOverride-1}[eight million
stories]{.CharOverride-2}[ part---as I assemble the essays for this
issue of ]{.CharOverride-1}[Rootstalk ]{.CharOverride-2}[which community
members in Grinnell, Iowa, worked up with Jon Andelson, me and our
students in the community writing workshop we convened last spring. Our
workshop\'s participants included small-town politicians, a retired
teacher, a social worker, a pair of retired farmers, a professional
woodworker, a coffee shop owner, and one of the town\'s barbers. While
the stories they produced didn\'t quite add up to eight million, they
were striking nonetheless for their variety, depth and poignancy. None
of our workshop participants were professional storytellers. And yet, by
turns, they shared passages from their lives that were warm, funny,
instructive, touching, and---to use a word that's much-overused these
days---]{.CharOverride-1}[diverse]{.CharOverride-2}[. I was surprised.
]{.CharOverride-1}

[A]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[s I think of it now, though, I
shouldn't have been. Having grown up myself in a town with fewer people
in it than Grinnell's 10,000, I know better than to sell my neighbors
short. I guess I'm as guilty as the next person of putting my head down
and focusing only on the next step rather than the landscape that's
opening up around me. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[S]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[itting at the table with these
people was not a little humbling. I\'d known some of these folks for
years, and I figured I knew them pretty well---well enough, anyway, to
call them ]{.CharOverride-1}[neighbors ]{.CharOverride-2}[if not
]{.CharOverride-1}[friends.]{.CharOverride-2}[ And yet, many times
during our workshop, in response to something one of the participants
shared, I felt like saying: ]{.CharOverride-1}[I had no
idea\....]{.CharOverride-2}

[I ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[daresay I\'m not alone in this.
Most of us are in a great hurry to do what we need to do to live our
lives. We don\'t talk to each other, or if we do, too often we don\'t
really ]{.CharOverride-1}[listen ]{.CharOverride-2}[to each other,
because (we tell ourselves) we don\'t have time. We\'ve got to get to
work, got to fill our gas tank, got to pick up the kids from school, got
to hustle home to fix dinner, got to tick off the myriad of items on our
to-do list. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[hat\'s just modern life, right?
Fast-paced and all-consuming in all its particulars.
]{.CharOverride-1}[Sitting and listening during this workshop, though, I
was reminded that this ought not to be considered the natural order of
things. I shouldn\'t assume I know everything that\'s important about
]{.CharOverride-1}[anyone, ]{.CharOverride-2}[not even my friends and
neighbors]{.CharOverride-1}[. ]{.CharOverride-2}

[O]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[nce in a while, if I\'m lucky, I
receive a kick-in-the-pants reminder of this truth. If I remember to
exercise good judgement, keep my ears open and pay attention, I am
privileged to hear the sorts of stories my neighbors told on those
afternoons we convened in Grinnell\'s Drake Community Library. In towns
like Grinnell, across the prairie region and across the country, we too
often pass each other by without sparing each other a glance. And
yet---as our workshop experience showed me---if we slow down for an
afternoon, or even for a minute, how much we have to say to each other!
]{.CharOverride-1}

[I]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[n Whitman\'s \"Song of Myself,\"
he told us: ]{.CharOverride-1}[I am large. I contain multitudes.
]{.CharOverride-2}[It is salutary to be reminded that this is true, not
just for poets, but for all of us. I need to remember who's selling me
coffee, who's cutting my hair, who's teaching my children, who's caring
for my town's afflicted, who's growing my food, and making sure the
police get paid and the water that flows from my tap is clean. The
people who do all these jobs are "just" my neighbors, but their lives
are as rich, complicated, intense and urgent---as big---as mine or
anyone else's, no matter the size of the town or the city or the acreage
they call home. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[T]{._idGenDropcap-1}[wenty eight years ago, on a cool August evening,
our family---consisting of my husband David and me, our three kids
Josiah, Katie, and Nathanael, and a hound dog---turned a huge corner in
our lives and, with great anticipation, pulled off Interstate 80 at mile
marker 182 to begin our life in Grinnell, Iowa. A few weeks earlier, my
husband had received a call to be the new pastor at Immanuel Lutheran
Church, a small church north of the high school, with cornfields in its
backyard. We knew little of Grinnell, only that it was sandwiched
between Iowa City and Des Moines, it had a small, world-renowned liberal
arts college located in it, and it was a half-day's drive from Grandma's
and Grandpa's house.]{.CharOverride-26}

[O]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[n our family's second day in
Grinnell we walked to the public library. This was something we did
wherever we moved because we learned that you can tell a lot about a
community by its library, especially considering what it offers
children. As we drew closer, we could see some kind of activity on the
front lawn. Old and young were at tables folding multi-colored paper
squares into paper cranes. One thousand of them. I have always
remembered the date: August 6, 1990, the 45th anniversary of the bombing
of Hiroshima. The staff at the library offered this activity in order to
teach children about this tragic event in world history, but in a way
that gave them hope. It became our first memory of living in Grinnell.
After joining the activity and making our cranes, we walked into the
beautiful library with its rich, warm wood and its smell of thousands of
books. We loved the glass floor in the upstairs stacks and the glass
ceiling one saw looking up from below. Through the time to come, we
would return again and again to enjoy this treasure in
Grinnell.]{.CharOverride-26}

[A]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[s we settled into our new life ,
we slowly began to discover the things that made Grinnell seem a special
place to us. Through my husband's job as pastor, through mine teaching
5th grade at Grinnell Middle School, and through the friendships our
kids, Nathanael, Katie, and Josiah, formed at school, faces around town
began to have names. We started learning the stories of the people who
live here, and they began to learn ours. We developed friendships that
would last a lifetime and that have made our lives so much richer and
more joyful.]{.CharOverride-26}

[F]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[or instance, there was the day
when we were walking to Merrill Park, just down the street from where we
lived, and saw a little boy about four years old crouched down on the
sidewalk with a bowl full of water. He looked to be about our son's age,
so we stopped to talk with him for a little while. When we asked him
what he was doing, he responded, "Drowning ants." Our son had just met
the boy who would be his best friend growing up. They bonded through
riding bikes, playing baseball, playing their instruments in marching
band, running cross country. Later, that boy was a groomsman in our
son's wedding. We still laugh remembering that day. No other place on
earth has Hamburger Hill, which is the spot on the golf course where
kids go sledding in Grinnell on sparkling white winter snow days, or
Dari Barn, where chocolate ice cream in a cup with crunch makes any day
in summer a holiday. Where else can you hear the sounds of a bagpipe
band coming from the neighbor's backyard, or attend world class music
concerts and sporting events at Grinnell College with no admission fee?
And---maybe the best thing---students from around the world who teach us
of the culture of their home country and, in return, take something of
Grinnell back home with them.]{.CharOverride-26}

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[his past October my husband and
I were in a small church in Cape Breton, in northern Nova Scotia, to
attend a Celtic service called 'The Blessing of the Kilts'. I had just
signed the guest book with our names and hometown, when a lady
breathlessly approached me and asked, "Are you from Grinnell, Iowa?"
When I responded that yes, we were, she took my hand and said that her
husband had graduated from Grinnell High School and Grinnell College and
had just been in Grinnell the week before to attend the high school
homecoming parade celebrating his 50th year class reunion. She was so
happy to talk to us and introduce us to her husband. After visiting with
them for a while we learned that he had grown up in the house next door
to where we live. Whispers of Grinnell seem to follow you wherever you
go. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[O]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ur children have let us know
that we can never move away from Grinnell, because they always want to
come back here. Our daughter's friends, who are scattered around the
country, call Grinnell a 'rubber band' community. No matter how far away
you go, you always want to come back to Grinnell. To come back
home.]{.CharOverride-26}

[L]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ast September our son came home
to celebrate his 40th birthday. When we asked him what he would like to
do, he said he wanted to get his childhood buddies together and play
Home Run Derby down at Merrill Park, where they had played so often when
they were kids. We collected several buckets of the baseballs we had
carefully stored away in our basement, grabbed a few of the old baseball
gloves, and headed to the park. Our son drove down from Cedar Rapids
that morning; others came from Ankeny and some from down the road or
around the block. They came now with their own sons. For a morning we
watched them run and hit and laugh and throw, transported to a more
carefree time: being 13 years old on a beautiful blue-sky September
day.]{.CharOverride-26}

to its slogan, the "Jewel of the Prairie." How fortunate we've been to
live in such a special place.]{.CharOverride-26}

[H]{._idGenDropcap-1}[otrods. The pastime of cruising your pride and joy
down Main Street, racing to impress the hometown crowd, is a lost art of
a long gone era in Grinnell, Iowa. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[High Octane Beginnings]{.CharOverride-6}[ ]{.CharOverride-29}

[I ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[lived in the country and
graduated from the eighth grade at Ewart School. I then moved to
Grinnell with my folks. A second-hand bicycle was the incentive to
attend high school. Before I ever got my license, I drove with my
parents to "Seven Mile Corner," and a patrolman came along and stopped
us. He said I was a good driver, but I was too short and, of course, had
no license. He gave me a five dollar fine, which my father paid. In
1945, five dollars was quite a bit of money! When I finally got my
license, I was restricted to sitting on a pillow when I
drove.]{.CharOverride-1}

[D]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[uring high school, I bought a
motorbike, which would reach upwards of 50 mph, but I didn't get my
first "hot car" until I graduated in 1948: a 1932 Model B Ford, black. I
had to pay for the car myself. Once outta' high school, I worked at
Central Meat Market for \$30 a week cutting meat, and that's how I paid
for it. The Ford had a V8 engine and spare wheels in each of the front
fenders. At that time it was one of the fastest cars in Grinnell, and I
thought it was real cool.]{.CharOverride-1}

[B]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ack then everybody would be
downtown, just messing around. The girls would walk the block and the
boys would "scoop the loop," driving real slow to show off their cars.
We used to race anyone we could those nights. This was after people got
done with work, because, you see, everybody worked back then. You'd see
somebody, pull up beside them and then ask if they'd wanna race. Chances
were the other guy would be driving the other way, and you'd just stop
in the middle of the road and decide where you'd race to. Then, you'd go
out to the edge of town, line up and take off, ending at Seven Mile
Corner on the other edge of town. The Seven Mile Corner was the
intersection of Highway 63 to Tama and Route Six to Malcom, a local
landmark. The girls were young and silly and they'd always be two or
three together. You'd always have buddies in the car with you. It was
never a one-on-one thing. My friends would be rooting for me in the back
of the car. We lost very few races in town.]{.CharOverride-1}

[ ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}

[Hot Hand ]{.CharOverride-6}

[I ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[think we only had around three
or four police then. The chief at the time was Glen Bell. I knew two of
the local police pretty well. They drove Pontiacs and always rode two in
a car around town. Once in a while they would even play "ditchum" with
us, with them "chasing" us around, but more often than not, we would end
up "losing" them. Caution, do not try this at home
kids!]{.CharOverride-1}

[O]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ne officer lived two blocks down
from me: he seemed big and intimidating back then. But he was about as
close to being a buddy and as friendly as you could get, at least for a
police officer. He knew what I did with my car. One time he caught me as
I was racing my friend Jerry from this little hamburger joint, over
where Lincoln Bank is now, and up Sixth Avenue. He caught me right about
where the new library is. Jerry's dad had just got a new Oldsmobile. And
the cop teased, "You've got a pretty poor car to be racing that new
Oldsmobile," and I said, "Well, I bet I could take you!" And so we raced

they'd go out at least three-quarters of a mile out of town to Lang's
Dairy. Oh, I beat them a coupla times. The officer wouldn't really say
anything when I'd win. Makes sense, since if word got out they were
racin', they'd probably be in big trouble. All he knew was that I had
the hottest car in town.]{.CharOverride-1}

[U]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[nfortunately, "the hottest car
in town" eventually came to an end. The car was light in the rear-end,
which made it possible to slide it around corners fast without
upsetting; however, the car had one big drawback: it was very hard on
transmissions. You had to replace the transmissions at least half a
dozen times, so it got to be almost second nature. Transmissions cost
five dollars. That was a lot of money for back then, as I've already
said. You'd have to go to the junkyard to get a replacement. It had to
be a Ford transmission. Fortunately, the local junkyard kept me in good
supply. A friend and I could change one out in two to three
hours.]{.CharOverride-1}

[O]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ld Sam Berman ran the junkyard.
I knew him real well, and he'd chatter like a chipmunk, but he knew what
I wanted when I came. He didn't give me no discount; just wanted his
five dollars. He'd have probably let me have it on credit, though, if I
asked. The junkyard used to be over where the Fareway food store is now,
near ]{.CharOverride-1}a warehouse for Meadow Gold ice cream, where they
loaded into and out of trucks[. The junkyard would buy old cars, iron
and metal scraps, even animal hides. Back then they moved it all by hand
or with trucks; now they've got big cranes.]{.CharOverride-1}

people to come and watch. It used to be a pretty big deal; over a
hundred people would be in the bleachers on every Saturday night. We'd
work on it all day Saturday and then that night go and race. We'd fixed
it back up again Sunday so it'd run. Eddie Anderson, who had a body shop
in Grinnell, even raced in big time races like the one at the

at home in Jasper County, Iowa. Her father lost his farm in the Great
Depression, after which she, her parents and her sister lived on rented
farms and moved often, looking for a better farm. Her family farmed with
horses. She graduated from Newburg High School in 1951 and married Wayne
Selle in 1952. They worked his parents' farm south of Grinnell and had
four children, two of whom died around nine years of age from Cystic
Fibrosis. Wayne died in 1972. She met Allan Moyer, and they were married

life. To see the sun set in a blaze of glory, orange, pink and red; to
smell the new mown hay; to hear the first frogs croak in the spring\...
all are treasures.]{.CharOverride-26}[ ]{.CharOverride-1}

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[he decision to share this wonder
began when a preschool teacher in Newton was looking for a farm to bring
their children to visit. It was the beginning of years of
fun.]{.CharOverride-26}[ ]{.CharOverride-1}

[A]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[t our farm, we milked cows,
raised feeder pigs, and had beef cattle. Before the present ideas of
"safe" food, we served milk straight from the big stainless steel cooler
and deviled eggs from our hens.]{.CharOverride-26}[ ]{.CharOverride-1}

[G]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[athering eggs was the kids'
favorite. We cautioned them not to reach under setting hens. One little
boy stood too close to the nests and was pecked on his nose. He cried
and cried, and he probably hates chickens now!]{.CharOverride-26}[
]{.CharOverride-1}

[B]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ottle feeding baby calves, goats
or lambs was also a fun challenge for teachers and children. There were
baby animals of every kind to hold: chicks, ducks, kittens and rabbits.
With chicks hatching, there was shredded paper to jump and play
in.]{.CharOverride-26}

[ ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[C]{.CharOverride-1}[arrots or
apples were offered as treats for the donkey, deer, and llama. We even
had an unfriendly emu. Peacocks entertained with their large beautiful
tails spread as they strutted about. There were quail
too.]{.CharOverride-26}

[W]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[einer roasts or snack lunches
were enjoyed down in the timber, which was reached by hayride. The ride
was pulled by tractor or a team of two big black Percheron horses.
]{.CharOverride-26}

[A ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[typical wooden outhouse was
provided in the timber with mixed reactions. The girls were reluctant to
venture in. Spiders you know! The boys on the other hand loved it and
tried to peek through cracks when the girls went in.]{.CharOverride-26}

fun.]{.CharOverride-26}

[ ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[O]{.CharOverride-1}[n one
occasion in the timber, the neighbor's bull had appeared on our side of
the fence. The teacher and I were driving him back while a high school
boy remained with us. He stayed behind us shouting, "I'm behind you,
I've got your backs." ]{.CharOverride-26}

["]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[Yeah right," we both thought,
but the moral support was appreciated.]{.CharOverride-26}

[ ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[W]{.CharOverride-1}[e typically
divided the children into three groups: one rode ponies, one gathered
eggs, and the other group fed animals and went to the hay mow in the
barn. Pony rides were complete with cowboy music and no lines to wait
in, except for the rides. Children would not go play on the big hay
bales for fear of missing their ride.]{.CharOverride-26}

[ ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[T]{.CharOverride-1}[wo geese
roamed the barnyard. Two grandmothers brought their very little
granddaughters to see the animals. They had known my husband for a long
time, and they visited as we toured. One of the geese grabbed the
littlest girl by the seat of her pants and would not let go! I was
frantically trying to reassure her, while the adults were laughing and
taking pictures of her. When we see them now, they all still laugh about
the goose story.]{.CharOverride-26}

[ ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[H]{.CharOverride-1}[andicapped
adults and children were also visitors to the farm. After visiting with
the animals the children would often smile and try to talk to the
delight of their teachers. Animals were good therapy, especially the
ponies.]{.CharOverride-26}

[ ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[T]{.CharOverride-1}[here was
also a wedding, a church service, a square dance Christmas in the barn,
as well as performances by various music groups. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[B]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[efore the holiday season, the
Rev. David Brandt \[see "A Place to Call Home," by Bridget Brandt, also
in this issue\] approached us with the idea of a Christmas Service in
the barn. We thought it was a great plan and moved forward removing all
the kiddy things possible. We made a pen for lambs, a cage for a rooster
and disguised a llama as a camel at the bottom of the ramp. Weather was
good and a few heaters made it comfortable. The rooster crowed
repeatedly through it all, and that was what people remembered. We
enjoyed this for three years, I believe, but the last year it was very
cold and that cold put an end to a nice part of our
memories.]{.CharOverride-26}

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[he wedding came about from a
request from our granddaughter, who wanted a Western wedding in the
barn. Her fiance had friends in Missouri who brought their horses and
camped in the timber. Their job was to park cars.The rehearsal dinner
was a fancy chuckwagon dinner in the timber where the cowboys were
camping. Everything went well, and the service was very nice. The large
crowd sat across the haymow and our friends sang all the wedding music
accompanied by guitars.The weather was perfect, but when they walked
down the ramp from the barn a large black cloud was in the west.The
wedding party rode on our hayrack pulled by our black Percheron horses
to the American Legion Post building across Highway 146 \[in
Grinnell\].]{.CharOverride-26}

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[he bride's parents and the
cowboys rode horses and accompanied them.The local police stopped
traffic at the corner for them to cross.The wedding party had a large
umbrella, which they ended up needing because it rained and poured all
along the way.]{.CharOverride-26}

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[hankfully, they were dry, but
Allan and I were soaked. When we arrived at the Legion, the electricity
was off so we came home to get candles and leave the horses. A buffet
meal was in full swing when we returned and eventually the electricity
came back on. A memorable event to say the least!]{.CharOverride-26}

[F]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[inally, when Al Gore was a
presidential hopeful, there was almost a visit to the farm. The whole
family had background checks and the Secret Service arrived in black
cars. We were all quite impressed. They checked everywhere for sniper
hiding places, even the attic in the house. Unfortunately, the final
decision arrived when not enough telephone access could be available to
accommodate their needs. A big adventure, anyway.]{.CharOverride-26}

[ ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[O]{.CharOverride-1}[ccasionally
we hear from a mom or dad who visited our place as a kindergartner, and
they tell us about how their kids also enjoyed a visit to the farm. Many
friends, relatives, and neighbors made this all possible and are fondly
remembered by all our family. We haven't had school visits for many
years now. Almost all the animals have been sold off, but there is still
a donkey and a mule. They just seem a part of the place. And, of course
there are always cats milling around and hens in the chicken coop out
back.]{.CharOverride-26}

[I]{._idGenDropcap-1}[t was Halloween eve---or Beggars' Night, to all of
the little kids of the time---in my small Iowa town. It was a beautiful
and warm autumn day. The sun was shining, still high in the sky, leaves
were on the ground and though the grass had lost some of its beautiful
green luster, it seemed to us as if the summer of 1978 was still going
strong. We lived in an older neighborhood. A little one-block street
that continued on the other side of the tracks and was bordered by the
cemetery. A mix of ranch homes and two-stories; most of them older and
in various states of age. A very quiet street that you didn't turn down
unless you lived on it. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[O]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[n this day, as on so many others
during my youth, Penny, my older sister, was my companion. We were going
to go trick-or-treating, and we were teaming up with our cousins and
rural country counterparts : Jimmy and Donnie. Jimmy and I are the same
age, though I am the youngest of three siblings and Jimmy is the oldest
of three siblings. Jimmy and I often played together in our early
childhoods, and we attended our first day of kindergarten together. I'm
sure the four of us were an interesting sight: two blonde-haired
blue-eyed boys and two brown-haired blue-eyed girls. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[I ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[have no idea what our Halloween
costumes were that year. As was true with most children in our small
modest neighborhood, most often our costumes were homemade. My guess
would be that we were a clown, or a hobo, or a politically incorrect
Indian. All I know for sure is that our instructions were to stay
together and be home by dark. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[I]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[t took a community to keep kids
safe back in the day. Everybody was so much more cohesive, or aware of
our little world. We certainly followed instructions that evening, and
stayed together, because little kids are primarily pack animals. I don't
think there was a lot of planning; clearly, we knew where the best candy
was in town. We all knew where to go. It just comes from growing up in
your neighborhood, just learning and being aware. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[C]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[an you imagine? There was no
"don't talk to strangers," no "hold hands;" no cell phones, no hovering
parents. We were free. I think that stays fresh in any person's mind:
the first time they get to venture out on their own. I'm sure every
child can remember their first outing without their parent, and the
sense of freedom that came with it. I can remember that it was just very
exciting; something that has remained stamped in my mind: my first
opportunity to act like a young adult. Our parents were trusting us to
take care of ourselves. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[I ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[still live in this
picture-perfect little town, where I run the Saints Rest coffee shop,
and today, I have kids that walk to the coffee shop for the first time
by themselves. Because I know the kid, I can ask their parents a week
later, and they will be like, "Oh yeah, that was their first outing."
You know, if you're that kid, you remember that. I don't know how you
wouldn't remember that. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[I ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[just talked to someone recently
who said, "You have a very charming town," though---if you've grown up
here your whole life---I don't think you necessarily see that. The
picture is a bit more complicated than it seems to be on the surface---a
fact that's made clear by a recent movie, "Saints Rest." The movie was
made by an alumnus of the College here; it's centered on my coffee shop,
and it brings the sense of complication to the forefront. This is just a
small town---kind of sheltered, which is why there's a false feeling of
safety. I'd say we're slower, not only in pace, but just behind the
times. Back then---I can tell you---my family was so far behind. I
remember getting television when everyone already had it.
]{.CharOverride-1}

[S]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[o, anyway, there we were on the
western-most street of town, running full-speed away from our little
neighborhood, pillow cases in hand and gleeful determination on our
faces.]{.CharOverride-1}

[ ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[We didn't do anything naughty;
naughty was five years off, when I'd TP houses, and do other nasty,
naughty things. That night, we were really focused on candy. Who has
time to dilly-dally when candy is all you really want? No, that night,
as we ran down the street, it was candy, candy, candy.
]{.CharOverride-1}

[F]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[irst, we headed north to the
"rich" neighborhoods. Big fancy houses with beautifully manicured yards,
nice sidewalks and porch lights that beckoned to us. These houses always
had the best candy, sometimes even full-size bars! Not an apple in
sight. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[here was only one guy that I can
remember who decorated his house. His name was Jim Haines. He did a
cemetery in his front yard, with smoke, and lights, and he dressed
up---I want to say he was a werewolf, or something---he scared the crap
out of us. We ran, screaming, and I don't think I got any candy.
Decorating back then clearly wasn't as dominant as it is now. Not even
close. I don't have any memories of that; I barely have memories of
Christmas lights, as a kid. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[A]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[nyway, after heading north, we
would head east, then south and then back home. Funny that I don't
remember coming home that night. I simply remember the leaving. But I do
remember our pillow cases getting heavy. I remember a few bits and
pieces; but nothing as clear to me as running away from our house and
into the beautiful unknown.]{.CharOverride-1}

[W]{._idGenDropcap-1}[e arrived in Iraq under the cover of darkness. We
were a large deployment group from Wilford Hall Medical Center, Lackland
Air Force Base, San Antonio, Texas. Many of us knew each other, but to
say we were well acquainted would be a stretch. After all, Wilford Hall
was the largest medical facility in the Air Force. The range of
relationships prior to our deployment was all over the map, much like
the range of backgrounds and hometowns that make up every military unit.
We'd been trained and trained well, but would that be enough? How would
we perform in a high tempo mass casualty environment? It was August,
2004, and we were entering a war zone, specifically Operation Iraqi
Freedom.]{.CharOverride-1}

[W]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[e were assigned to the 332nd
Expeditionary Medical Squadron located on Balad Air Base
(]{.CharOverride-1}https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balad\_Air\_Base[)
forty miles north of Baghdad. We had every function of a civilian
hospital including surgical capability, radiology, pharmacy, supply,
logistics, and so on, all housed under rows of canvas tents connected by
one long, main hallway. Each tent that extended perpendicularly from the
hallway housed a different section of the hospital. I was assigned to
the Medical/Surgical Ward, which was actually housed in three of these
tents.]{.CharOverride-1}

[I]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[raq was very different from the
small Iowa town where I was raised, right down to the very soil. Iowa is
known for its fertile fields while the soil in Iraq more closely
resembled baby powder with a slightly tan tint to it. In fact,
everything in Iraq had a tan tint to it, the sand, the tents, our
uniforms, everything. The lush green rows of crops that grow in my home
state were nowhere to be seen there.]{.CharOverride-1}

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[hroughout my training, I'd tried
to prepare myself for the wounded American and coalition forces that we
might care for. What was surprising were the number of civilian and
quite possibly enemy combatants that we would be expected to treat. And
it was these patients that we would see for much longer periods of time.
Aeromedical evacuation or "aerovac" was so efficient that we rarely saw
the same American casualties for more than a shift or two. More often
than not we'd return for our next shift hoping to check on the status of
a patient only to discover that they had been Aerovacc'd out to Germany
or even stateside. It was one of these Iraqi patients who would steal
our hearts and become a ray of light in the darkness.]{.CharOverride-1}

[H]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[is name was Sajad, and he was
already a resident of the hospital when we arrived. We guessed he was
somewhere around four years old, but no one knew for sure. An Army
patrol had found him in a local village. His leg had been badly burned
and had healed in a flexed position, making it impossible to straighten.
No one knew how or when his injury had taken place, but what was certain
was that this little guy would never walk again without surgical
intervention. Even with cultural and religious barriers, it was
communicated to the boy's family that our facility could help and they
consented. He began a series of surgeries where the scar tissue that
bound his leg was cut away and replaced with layers of skin from his
little back. I'm not sure how many surgeries he had endured prior our
arrival, but he had not yet walked.]{.CharOverride-1}

[W]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[e all enjoyed caring for Sajad.
When he was coming out of anesthesia following one of his procedures,
we'd hold him until he awoke and was reacquainted with his surroundings.
I doubt that I'd take to the diet most Iraqis live on, but I do believe
Sajad was quite pleased with what he tasted of ours, especially candy.
He would devour anything put in front of him, and there were plenty of
care packages to share. I'm not sure I'd ever seen a belly swell like
his did after one of his binge sessions. This, as you might expect, led
to the least enjoyable aspect of caring for Sajad, as he was still
dependent on diapers. We finally had to hang a sign above his bed
stating in large block letters, "PLEASE DO NOT FEED THE
CHILD!!!"]{.CharOverride-1}

[A]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[fter each surgical procedure,
Sajad's leg would be in a hard cast or some sort of splint to keep it
immobilized. Walking with a bent leg was impossible, but teaching him to
walk with straight, stiff leg was going to be a challenge. Someone found
one of those round baby walkers with wheels that he could sit in and
this worked amazingly well. Sajad was off and running. It meant he
required much more supervision, but it was a joy to see a child play,
especially in the environment we were surrounded by. We couldn't help
but wonder whether this was his first time experiencing this kind of
freedom. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[W]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[e worked on weening him away
from the walker. We would often stand him up and toss a soccer ball at
him. Prompting him to kick it back. This was quite effective at working
on his balance and agility. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[I ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[definitely knew that many of
those I was serving with were extremely fond of little Sajad. Who could
blame them? He was as cute as could be. He smiled constantly and rarely
fussed. One of the fondest memories I have was one of those moments when
you hear a new word or words from a youngster, and know he or she
understands the proper use of that vocabulary. Obviously, there was a
language barrier between us, but one day I was holding Sajad and out of
nowhere he gave me a big hug, smiled and said "I love you." My heart
absolutely melted. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[W]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[e all wanted to see him
progress, but I don't think we correlated this with him leaving us.
After all, he'd been with us for the majority of our deployment. It only
seemed logical that we'd be able to keep him. Sajad's family had only
visited a few times in the more than two months he'd been with us. We
often wondered if they'd abandoned him. I was so convinced of this, and
was certainly so attached that I actually had my First Sergeant contact
the U.S. Embassy on my behalf to look into my adopting Sajad. They made
it clear that that scenario was not possible. I now believe that his
family probably had transportation or financial obstacles that kept them
away.]{.CharOverride-1}

[O]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ur feelings for Sajad were never
clearer than they were on the day we learned his family was picking him
up. Word spread through the hospital like a wildfire. I rushed to his
bed as soon as I heard. There was a group of around half-a-dozen medical
personnel there, which was about half-a-dozen more than were needed, but
we all wanted to say goodbye. The mood that followed was worse than
anything we'd experienced to date, and we'd experienced a lot. We'd set
records for the number of casualties aerovac'd out of the area of
operation, so you can imagine the level of carnage we'd been exposed to.
Our affection for our little mascot was clear and became even clearer a
few weeks later when Sajad returned for a follow-up. Again, the news
flew through the facility, and again I raced to find him. When I located
him, he was surrounded by staff members and of course, eating. When our
eyes met, he lit up and his big smile met mine.]{.CharOverride-1}

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[here's one memory in particular
that connects the life I led in Iraq with the life I am leading today in
my home town. I was one of the higher-ranking personnel in the hospital,
and functioned as a shift supervisor. Those who worked for me had
specific patients to care for, and duties assigned to them. I had much
more flexibility, which allowed me to spend more time with Sajad, and
I'd often carry him with me as I made my rounds. One day I noticed his
hair was getting a little shaggy and decided a haircut was in
order.]{.CharOverride-1}

[A]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[s you might imagine, this
mission had a high chance of failure. After all, no one can predict how
a child will behave in a barber chair, and that's without a language
barrier. Sajad seemed to trust me. I guess we'd bonded pretty well by
this point, but honestly, I'm sure he was ready for a change of scenery.
So, I loaded him up in the Hummvee, buckled him in the passenger seat
and we were off to the barbershop. I don't remember now if he gave me
much trouble in the barber chair, but I do remember holding him in my
lap as the barber did his thing, and I remember working up quite a sweat
doing it. He was sure a hit with everyone we encountered that afternoon.
Smiling and greeting them all, bringing a smile to their faces as well.
He certainly looked sharp with that new cut and it seemed he knew it as
well.]{.CharOverride-1}

[I]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[t's interesting to note that,
many years later, retired from the Air Force, I find myself back in my
hometown, cutting hair in my own small-town barbershop. I had a friend
once tell me that she thought it was really cool that I had joined the
military like my father, and was now doing hair like my mother, who was
a beautician. I'm fine with where things ended up. There aren't many
things you can do in life that give you immediate gratification from
your work, but I have that privilege. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[here are probably many things
that shape a man and who he will become. I like to think we had a
variety of missions while in Iraq but most important to me was the
healing of hearts and minds. Hopefully, little Sajad will never don a
suicide vest or detonate a vehicle born IED (Improvised Explosive
Device). Hopefully, he shares his memories with friends and family of
the nice Americans that made it possible for him to walk. In a perfect
world, I imagine him as a community or national leader, working to erase
the hatred that seems so prevalent in his culture. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[hese days I get to turn folks of
all ages around to unveil their new haircut and see their initial
response. Fortunately, that response is usually positive. Many times,
the customer is a young boy who can't hide the pride he feels in how he
looks. Much like little Sajad on our barbershop adventure that sunny day
in Iraq.]{.CharOverride-1}

]{.CharOverride-26}[h]{.CharOverride-1}[ttps://www.grinnellarts.org),
located in the heart of downtown Grinnell, Iowa, is a community center
that hosts exhibits, concerts, plays, celebrations, and classes. Of
particular interest to me this past spring was "Studio 6," the Arts
Council's Monday-through-Thursday after school program that attracts
]{.CharOverride-26}[a]{.CharOverride-1}[pproximately 20 to
25]{.CharOverride-26}[ ]{.CharOverride-1}[students. The kids attending
Studio 6 come from different backgrounds in the town, and adult
artist/mentors guide them in working with one another to create pieces
of art that reflect their cohesion as a classroom.]{.CharOverride-26}

[D]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[uring the spring class I was
involved in, the Studio 6 kids ]{.CharOverride-1}[worked on a myriad of
art projects. Sometimes they paved their own paths in personal,
individual projects; sometimes they worked together to create something
great and grand. In response to this issue's theme of community, I
decided to explore how the children of the Studio 6 classroom could
represent their own definition of community in a mural. I reached out to
GAAC staff member/teachers Katie In and Alesia Lacina and told them I
was interested in doing a project. They excitedly agreed to spearhead a
mural project where Studio 6 students would create an image that
reflected what community meant to them. Within weeks, we created
mural-esque scenes on the classroom walls, and unleashed the kids to
create. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[I ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[went to two Studio 6 classes in
which students produced two separate murals. Both had similar initial
prompts, beginning with the depiction of large trees. Before we started
the project, though, I talked with the students to help guide what this
mural would look like. We prompted the students with questions like,
"What do you think community is?" ]{.CharOverride-26}

[I]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[nterestingly, the two classes'
differing concept of community was reflected in their answers,
discussions, and later in the murals they created. The first class's
discussion emphasized sharing, peace, and caring for others. The second
class's mural centered on the kids' ideas about who community members
were, and explored the theme of working together. This group continually
mentioned firefighters, police officers, and the idea of working
together to "make something."]{.CharOverride-26}

[I ]{._idGenDropcap-1}[spied the tee-shirt amidst a plethora of choices
online one evening while looking for a gag gift for one of our adult
children. I've never been much of a tee-shirt person myself, believing
that one's chest and back serve higher purposes than sending messages
via a cotton sandwich board. Although, to be honest, I did buy myself a
tee-shirt the first day of each of my 17 RAGBRAIs
(]{.CharOverride-1}https://ragbrai.com[). They've become badges of
accomplishment albeit a little ragged from the wear. Curiously, this
particular tee-shirt I stumbled upon spoke to me in an ethereal manner.
Connecting with whatever spirituality I harbor someplace or another
within my being. A deeply personal spirituality that didn't manifest
itself until the kids left home and I finally had time to think. This
tee-shirt's message was simple:]{.CharOverride-1}

[I ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[INTEND TO LIVE
FOREVER]{.CharOverride-1}

[ ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ so far, so good
]{.CharOverride-1}

[ ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[I knew immediately and innately
that I must own it. Machine wash, warm, inside out with like colors.
Only non-chlorine bleach. Tumble dry medium. Do not iron. Do not dry
clean.]{.CharOverride-1}

[ ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[By the time I had wandered into
my 50s, the notion that I might live forever (and ever) had quietly
emerged from somewhere, taking on form and substance. I acknowledged its
quirky presence, neither discouraging such a possibility nor questioning
why I might be the exception. Rather, I've always tended toward a
come-what-may approach. If it works, fine. If not, okay. There are other
paths all over the place, just waiting to be trod. Which paths we
choose, which direction we go now, which direction we go later, blend in
to become our personal footprints in the sand. And while the
elements---wind, rain, water, snow---sooner or later erase physical
footprints, the history of who we are, where we come from, what we
accomplish and, ultimately, what we leave behind, melds into the
universe. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[ ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[For a very long while now, we
humans have been packaging up our past, putting bits and pieces of our
decades into sentences and paragraphs to become obituaries for the
newspaper and the funeral home, for family, friends, and for posterity.
Having the last word, so to speak. And for so many reasons, that is
extremely important.]{.CharOverride-1}

[ ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[The obituary dates back to the
early 16th century, its journey to now riding a wave of rich history. An
obit is not a biography; that's an account of someone's life and is
written by another person. Nor is the obituary an autobiography; that's
an account of someone's life written by the person who's living
it---obviously up to a certain point. Nor is it a memoir; that's an
historical account or biography one writes from personal knowledge or
special sources. It tends more toward the story-telling
vein.]{.CharOverride-1}

[O]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[bituaries, gathered collectively
and over time, embody our historical journey as a people, as well as our
personal family history. From these "short stories" we can come to
appreciate the roles generations have played in our past.
]{.CharOverride-1}

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[he word "obituary" comes from
the Latin obit, meaning death. Brief announcements of death were
published in America as early as the 16th century. But not until the
19th century, and following a lead from the British, our obits became
more detailed accounts, appearing with regularity in the
press.]{.CharOverride-1}

[A]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[t the time of the Civil War,
obituaries for soldiers often included sentiment and religious
overtones. This is also when embalming began to find favor because it
meant bodies would arrive home intact. Toward the end of the century,
"death journalism" emerged. Obituaries in both England and the United
States focused on the graphic and often morbid details of the person's
death, a trend that continued into the 20th century. Theodore Roosevelt,
president from 1901-1909, died in his sleep at age 60. His obituary in
]{.CharOverride-1}[The New York Times]{.CharOverride-2}[
]{.CharOverride-1}[(]{.CharOverride-36}[h]{.CharOverride-37}[ttps://www.nytimes.com]{.CharOverride-38}[)
]{.CharOverride-36}[led with an elaborate description of the blood clot
that "detached itself from a vein and entered the
lungs."]{.CharOverride-1}

[F]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[or a short while, obituaries in
verse form had their day in the sun. Consider "A Tribute to Guy Swain,"
a Delaware, Ohio, man who fell to his death while trying to chase a
raccoon from his tree one night:]{.CharOverride-1}

[ ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[A precious one is

bad,]{.CharOverride-1}

[ ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[The way you had to go.
]{.CharOverride-1}

[I]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[t wasn't until the latter part
of the 20th century that obituaries began to routinely recognize
ordinary people as well as the aristocracy. I'm in the "ordinary"
category, and probably most of you are as well. Because of this shift to
us everyday people, anybody can die and the obit can appear in the
newspaper. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[I]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[nitially, these obituaries
included a notice of death, an account of the person's life and
information about the upcoming funeral. A family member either submitted
that information to the funeral home or filled out a form provided by
the funeral home. This was then sent to the newspaper office where a
professional journalist---almost always a cub reporter---wrote the
obituary and a professional proofreader checked it for errors. In the
]{.CharOverride-1}[Des Moines Register's ]{.CharOverride-2}[newsroom,
for example, this good-to-go copy then traveled to the composing room,
then on to the pressroom. Mistakes were almost
non-existent.]{.CharOverride-1}

[ ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[I launched my journalism career
in 1965, at the ]{.CharOverride-1}[Register]{.CharOverride-2}[. Back
then, the only newspaper in the United States with more Pulitzers was
the ]{.CharOverride-1}[New York Times.]{.CharOverride-2}[ Heady stuff,
but new hires were still newbies. Gals wrote weddings, engagements and
club news; guys wrote weather, obits and entries from the police
blotter. For about a year, actually. After that, if you were still
upright and mobile, you could stop worrying about getting axed by the
managing editor and start writing real articles.]{.CharOverride-1}

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[he latest winds of change, as
far as obituaries are concerned, have been fanned by Social Media's
penchant for putting everything on the table. Dubbed the "Personalized
Obituary," they're now written by a family member, a friend or even the
deceased person, obviously ahead of time. Funeral homes, as well as the
Internet, provide a plethora of information and assistance. Today,
factual information, as well as insights into the life of the deceased,
have become the norm. Once written, obituaries are sent directly to the
newspaper's advertising department for layout and design. Nobody proofs
what you've written so no errors are corrected before press time. Hence,
people: be meticulous with your submissions.]{.CharOverride-1}

[A]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[nother change: When we "regular
folks" began writing our family obituaries, the first eight lines were
often free-of-charge. That's not the case anymore, so
]{.CharOverride-1}[caveat emptor. ]{.CharOverride-2}[Know cost-per-word
for copy and cost-per-size of photo. The obituary has become a reliable
source of income for newspapers. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[hat said, for some people,
paying for even a short obituary can become a huge issue. Funeral
directors may suggest the family run only the Basic Death Notice in the
local newspaper. Then, the family may post a more comprehensive obituary
on the funeral home's website. Funeral homes generally pay to have their
logo and website included with these obituaries, so the family may not
incur any costs.]{.CharOverride-1}

[W]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ith the increasing popularity of
social media in the early 2000s, news organizations began selling
obituaries to online sites such as legacy.com, the largest commercial
provider of on-line memorials---probably in the universe, but I haven't
checked. Even if no funeral is looming large in your family's near
future, look at legacy's homepage. It's a mini-magazine of stuff to
read: how to write an obituary that will preserve your loved one's life
in story---how to prepare for a traditional Muslim burial---an
opportunity to search for obituaries by newspaper---remembering Andrew
Wyeth on his 100th birthday. The offerings, like the Internet itself,
are endless.]{.CharOverride-1}

[I]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[n case you haven't noticed,
Social Media has also conditioned us to share information with complete
strangers. Hence, sites like obitkit.com. Its creator Susan Soper says,
"We're more open and apt to have a sense of humor rather than denial
about death. People want to celebrate someone for who they are, not for
some cookie-cutter person." ]{.CharOverride-1}

old and the young, praising their individuality while cutting through
their differences to capture the poignancy of their shared similarity:
life cut short in an American tragedy. Eventually, "Portraits" grew to
more than 1,800 profiles. ]{.CharOverride-1}

as loose or as tight as the family sees fit. Some obituaries still fit
into the proper constraints of etiquette. Others wander outside those

the passages:]{.CharOverride-1}

["]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[Irene grew up on the diversified
family dairy farm, baking pies for threshing crews, gathering eggs from
the hen house and every autumn helping butcher and process hogs and
making gallons of apple butter for the family table.]{.CharOverride-1}

["]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[Later, she led a team of foods
teachers, introduced international foods classes to students and broke
with tradition by teaching boys' food preparation

[W]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ith this approach, readers learn
not only what a person did but also who the person was. Such
information-based storytelling weaves a sense of the local public into
our history. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[A]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[nd recently, a friend shared
that when her nephew, J. T. Sleyster, a college student in Wisconsin,
died by suicide, there was no obituary. Within 12 hours of his death,
the word was out on Facebook. "The first post I saw was, 'Rest in Peace,
J.T.'," his mother, Ann Wheeler of South Carolina, recalls. "That post
showed up on my Facebook page because I was Facebook friends with my
son. But it wasn't me who saw that post first."]{.CharOverride-1}

[A]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[fter seeing the numerous posts
about his death, with people asking for more information about the
service, two days later the family posted information about what had
happened, followed with a post requesting photos for a video. The final
post provided information about the visitation and funeral, including a
request that people wear flannels to the service since J.T. grew up in
Minnesota. ]{.CharOverride-1}

["]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[I do wish, now, that there would
have been an obituary, too," Ann says. "You want some of that tactile
information to remain. But it just went so fast."]{.CharOverride-1}

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[wo more points to consider.
First, until recently, including cause-of-death was required for
publication. Not so today, although I believe a solid argument for
inclusion remains. For example, the 1997 obituary for Orville Marlow,
from Perry, Iowa, listed cause of death as complications of Parkinson's
disease. In fact, the funeral director's wife had been passionate about
including the information. Since Mr. Marlow had run a gas station during
part of his career, she wondered about a possible link between his work
and Parkinson's. She thought such information in his obituary might be
useful for research purposes.]{.CharOverride-1}

[B]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ack when Mr. Marlow had been
diagnosed, his children asked the neurologist about hereditary factors
with Parkinson's. The doctor had thought that wasn't likely. Some years
after his death, though, the family learned that Mr. Marlow was likely
part of a "cluster," as three of his cousins had Parkinson's as well.
Recently, his son-in-law, a genealogist, found an obituary for Mr.
Marlow's half-brother, whom the family had never been aware of before.
He, too, had died of Parkinson's. Such historical knowledge for future
generations is lost without including cause of death in an
obituary.]{.CharOverride-1}

[A]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[lso to consider: Obituaries have
the power to make public statements. In 2017, Ethan Sergei Neubauer, 19,
of Urbandale, Iowa, took his life after struggling with depression,
anxiety, PTSD and survivor's guilt related to a tumultuous childhood in
Russia. His (adopted) mother who, years before, had worked for the
Associated Press, wrote a powerful obituary detailing the journey of
Sergei's short life. He'd first met Mary and dad Larry Loss through Camp
Hope when he visited Iowa as a youngster. The couple joyfully adopted
him. Sergei thought Mary to be very tall and found Larry's hair to be
quite white, but they seemed nice, laughed a lot and had great dogs.
Sergei played soccer, lifted weights, loved nature, graduated from high
school, and was interested in psychology and social work. He was able to
mask his own pain by keeping the focus on others as well. At the end of
the obituary, Mary made a public plea for policymakers to recognize the
toll of mental illness caused by legislative underfunding. The obit
concluded with four messages to others who struggle with the disease:
]{.CharOverride-1}

[1]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[. If you need help, ask for
it.]{.CharOverride-1}

[2]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[. Seek to build others up, not
tear them down. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[3]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[. Avoid drama. It does no
good.]{.CharOverride-1}

[4]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[. Recognize small moments of
joy, for they ]{.CharOverride-1}

[ ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[happen all the
time.]{.CharOverride-1}

[P]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[eggy Huppert, executive director
of the Iowa chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness
]{.CharOverride-1}[(]{.CharOverride-39}[h]{.CharOverride-40}[ttps://www.nami.org]{.CharOverride-41}[)]{.CharOverride-39}[,]{.CharOverride-1}[
sees Neubauer as a shining example of someone who turned personal
tragedy into social change. "Less than six months after Mary Neubauer
wrote the obituary," Huppert says, "she was standing beside the Governor
at the bill signing ceremony for a major mental health policy bill she'd
helped pass." ]{.CharOverride-1}

[S]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[o, back to my tee-shirt. It is
comforting to know that, overall, life really is "so far, so good." That
said, let me note that I never want to hold the record for being the
world's oldest living person. According to the Gerontology Research
Group
]{.CharOverride-1}[(]{.CharOverride-39}[h]{.CharOverride-40}[ttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerontology\_Research\_Group]{.CharOverride-41}[)]{.CharOverride-39}[,
right now that record belongs to Violet Brown, a 117-year-old Jamaican
woman. Nicknamed "Aunt V," she and her husband worked as cane farmers,
and Violet credits that hard work during her younger years for her
longevity. She was baptized 104 years ago, has a 97-year-old son and has
been going to church for more than a century. ]{.CharOverride-1}

["]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[I feel good, I feel happy to be
the oldest person (in the world)," Brown told the
]{.CharOverride-1}[Jamaica Observer
]{.CharOverride-2}[(]{.CharOverride-1}http://www.jamaicaobserver.com)[.
"I did not feel I would become the oldest person; I feel I would pass
long ago. Thank God for whatever He has given to me." ]{.CharOverride-1}

[ ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[In today's sometimes contentious
world, Violet's positive comments are laced with grace and wisdom. And
that's enough for me.]{.CharOverride-1}

[I]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}['m an archaeologist, so I get
calls occasionally: someone has an artifact they want me to look at.
Usually it's an 'arrowhead' they have just found, or a collection made
over the years or inherited from granddad. I don't encourage people to
collect artifacts without documenting location, because this removes
them from the site and diminishes the chances that they can tell us
anything about past people. Nevertheless, I try not to sound too
self-righteous about archaeological ethics when I talk to a friendly
member of the public. I always enjoy looking at someone's artifacts,
even if I secretly lament the loss of knowledge when objects are removed
from their original contexts. I can usually make a friend and tell them
something they find interesting. "See the beveled edge on this one? That
means it was probably resharpened---some of these big arrowheads were
actually spear and knife points." And so on. Archaeologists need to talk
to the public, not only because support for archaeology ultimately comes
from them, but because many great archaeological finds were made by the
farmer, the construction worker, or the curious kid who happened on
something unusual and told "the authorities." ]{.CharOverride-1}

[S]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ometimes the find is "big
bones." My heart beats a bit faster when I hear that, because Ice Age
mammal finds are not impossible in Iowa. When foundations were being dug
for one of the downtown stores in Grinnell in the late 1800s, pieces of
mammoth tusk turned up. They were displayed in the college's Parker
Museum of Natural History, a rather fine small collection that was
allowed to deteriorate through the 1950s and eventually bulldozed into
the ruins when an unusually stupid administration tore down most of our
attractive 19th Century buildings. Most such Pleistocene animals (not
administrators, but such things as mammoths, camels, and giant ground
sloths) lived before people populated North America, so properly
speaking, they are not archaeology. But they are still interesting, and
there is always the possibility that a mammoth might be late enough to
have been the prey of a Clovis hunter 13,000 years ago, which would make
it rare and important archaeology. However, a quick glance at the bones
usually tells me that we have found the last resting place of Dobbins
the forgotten workhorse or Daisy the elderly milk cow, disposed of in a
pit in the pasture, forgotten by the generations after
granddad.]{.CharOverride-1}

[O]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ne morning as I arrived early at
Grinnell College's Goodnow Hall, where I have my office, a uniformed
police officer climbed out of his cruiser and accosted me on the steps.
]{.CharOverride-1}

["]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[Are you Dr. Whittaker?"
]{.CharOverride-1}

[I ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[felt the twinge we all do when
confronting the legal authorities, but as far as I could remember I
hadn't done anything criminal, illegal, or even publicly embarrassing in
the last few weeks, so I admitted my identity. ]{.CharOverride-1}

["]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[Someone said you're the
archaeologist. A hunter found some bones we would like you to look at."
]{.CharOverride-1}

[W]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ow, my own episode of CSI
Grinnell! Human identification isn't my field, but there are indeed
anthropologists who specialize in forensic investigations, and I did
have basic human skeletal training with one of them, long ago in my
graduate student days. Inside my office we opened a box with the faint
fragrance of decay to reveal a set of long narrow bones held together by
some remnants of flesh and sinew. I was only slightly sorry to be able
to tell the officer immediately that this was not a human hand, but what
was left of the upper paw of a large mammal. A quick visit to my drawers
of animal specimens confirmed this: Dog. At least the police would not
have to waste time searching a crime scene for the rest of the
body.]{.CharOverride-1}

[N]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ot long ago I was asked to look
at another artifact collection. As usual, someone had called the
department, where our administrative assistant passed her on to me. The
woman seemed nice on the phone, and said she had a lot of 'old Indian
stuff'. She lived on a local farm, but now had to sell the farm and
move, and wanted her finds properly cared for. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[I ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[applauded the idea. Most
artifact collections, without any specifics about where they were found,
are largely useless except as teaching specimens. A collection from one
specific small area, however, could inform us about an important site
that should be investigated or preserved, or might at least represent
the range of different periods and people who had once occupied that
little river valley. Such collections, with documentary information, are
valuable and should be preserved. I asked the caller what she had. "Oh,
lots of arrowheads, all sorts of tools, some pottery." This was
encouraging. You never know what people may have found, and some very
odd things get called artifacts, but who could fail to recognize
arrowheads? ]{.CharOverride-1}

[W]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[e made an appointment, and I
drove several miles out of town, past grain elevators, through the
corridors of endless cornfields, over a shaky bridge crossing a small
stream, to a run-down farm, far from anything. A crippled windmill swung
in the breeze that whistled through gaps in the silos and shook the
rotting shingles on a leaning barn. The house was shabby but I've seen
worse. I was greeted at the door by a hideous but placid pit bull, who
was pushed aside by an indifferent cat, followed by a run-down looking
woman about my age. She introduced herself as Selma. A bit overweight,
stringy hair, dressed in a worn nightgown and puffing a cigarette---one
of Iowa's rural poor. Selma welcomed me through an entry that was
cluttered with dog and cat bowls and muddy shoes, led me past a kitchen,
and into the sitting room. ]{.CharOverride-1}

["]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[The kids are gone now," she
said, nodding at an age-graded series of fading high school photos.
"Hope you're not allergic to cats." ]{.CharOverride-1}

[A]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[s I sat on the hairy sofa and
submitted my knuckles to the bulldog's tongue. I felt a certain kinship
with Selma: the room was messy but clean, and she plainly suffered from
the collecting bug. Stacks of magazines, a large hoard of Tupperware, a
few too many pieces of furniture. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[M]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[y impressions of the room are
vague because my attention was focused on the large coffee table, on
which was spread her collection of "'artifacts'." My spirits sank. In
front of me, in tidy rows, was the ugliest collection of worthless rocks
I have ever seen. And I speak as one who likes worthless
rocks.]{.CharOverride-1}

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[hese are the finds that try my
soul. Selma had asked for my professional expertise, so I wouldn't lie
to her, but I didn't think she was going to want to hear what I had to
say. There were at least 200 little lumps of limestone and misshapen
bits of gravel. I took slight comfort when she said, drawing deeply on
her cigarette and coughing a bit, "I haven't been able to get out and
find more since the cancer." ]{.CharOverride-1}

[I ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[was sorry for her health
problems, but I certainly did not regret the lack of more 'artifacts.' I
spent a slow hour looking seriously at each miserable mineral, trying to
be polite and encouraging, trying to educate a bit. Friendly
Archaeologist: "Oh look, that's a nice fossil, probably a bit of horn
coral," and "That one is a piece of granite brought down south by the
glaciers, see how it's polished on one side."]{.CharOverride-1}

[ ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[Selma picked up one of the
rocks: "See how this fits my hand? Your thumb goes right here. I bet
they used this for scraping hides." ]{.CharOverride-1}

[I ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[restrained an eye-roll. They
always say that. If a piece of rock fits the finder's hand, however
dull, or ragged, or irregular, or boring, or natural and untouched by
human hands it may be, the would-be expert is convinced that they know
how it was used. To be fair, some archaeological interpretations are not
much more sophisticated, though we DO usually know the difference
between a rock and a tool. At some level, though, all artifacts take
their glamour from this kind of thinking. Whether you are an academic
like me or a farmer like Selma, understanding an arrowhead connects you
in some way with that interesting, vaguely imagined ancient life, when
monsters such as mammoths ruled the earth, when humans fought for
survival with their wits and simple tools\.... You would not believe
what appears on ebay as a 'genuine Indian thus-and-so.,' But that is
another story.]{.CharOverride-1}

[G]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ritting my teeth, I worked my
way across the table with Selma, one pebble at a time.
]{.CharOverride-1}

[S]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[elma: "Here's a really nice
arrowhead." ]{.CharOverride-1}

[M]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[e (mentally pulling my hair):
"Uh, well, actually... I think it's a bit of slate. That stuff sometimes
breaks with straight edges like that. It doesn't really seem to have
been worked on at all. But this one, this shiny stuff is chert, which is
what the Indians did make tools out of. See how it fractures with a
sharp edge...."]{.CharOverride-1}

[I]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[t was a long and dreary slog,
and she just wouldn't have any of it. I kept remembering the man who had
approached me once with a "Neanderthal necklace"---a group of purely
natural fossil bits---who left my office in a huff. Then there was the
man who kept trying to publish papers on his collection of obviously
faked nineteenth century "ancient carvings," and maintains that the
academics are suppressing his great find. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[F]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[inally I made my excuses to
Selma:. "Gotta get back and get ready for classes. Thanks for showing me
your stuff..." ]{.CharOverride-1}

[W]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[e parted on good terms. Although
we really didn't do much for each other, I like to hope that I left her
feeling that academics aren't too stuck-up to talk to citizens, even if
we must be kinda stupid. At the door she closed the episode perfectly.
"I do want my stuff taken care of. Do you think anyone at the Meskwaki
Tribe (]{.CharOverride-1}https://meskwaki.org[) would be interested?"

to the otter, badger, marten, weasel, ferret, and wolverine, and like
them is an aggressive carnivore, hunting rodents, fish, crustaceans,

[F]{._idGenDropcap-1}[or over century, North American prairie landscapes
have been transformed and degraded by industrial monocrop agriculture,
urban and suburban development, the introduction of non-native species,
and the suppression of periodic fire. Whether we speak of loss of
topsoil, the proliferation of invasive species and disappearing native
biodiversity, or the spread of urban sprawl and the destruction of
natural habitats, Euro-American communities have not managed prairie
ecosystems with an eye to their persistence. The use and treatment of
the prairies has proceeded under the assumption that productive human
landscapes are constructed by rearranging, eliminating, and replacing
natural ecosystem components in pursuit of short-term financial gain
(Mutel 2008). ]{.CharOverride-1}

[O]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ver the last two decades, the
members of Dancing Rabbit Ecovillage
]{.CharOverride-1}[(https://www.dancingrabbit.org)
]{.CharOverride-49}[in Scotland County, Missouri, have experimented with
a different approach to using and inhabiting a 280-acre parcel of the
prairie landscape. These activists' approach to what Gary Snyder and
other bioregionalists call "reinhabitation" is grounded in cooperation
among humans, places a high value on ecological processes and
other-than-human inhabitants of the prairies, and incorporates
restoration ecology practices into community life. These 'Rabbits', as
they call themselves, are recreating the commons on the prairies and, in
the process, building new identities and a new community for themselves.
Their efforts stand in stark contrast to state-based and individualized,
market-driven approaches to land management that have dominated the
utilization of prairie ecosystems in the United States.
]{.CharOverride-1}

[The Commons]{.CharOverride-50}

[I]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[n 2009, Elinor Ostrom
(]{.CharOverride-1}https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor\_Ostrom[) won
the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for the decades of work she spent
demonstrating that groups of people around the world can and do
sustainably manage natural resources by developing and using their own
de facto systems of rules and norms grounded in local cultural and
ecological contexts. Summarizing the findings of Ostrom and her
colleagues, David Bollier (]{.CharOverride-1}http://www.bollier.org[)
states, "In a commons, the structural pressures to earn money are
reduced and the incentives to take into account subtle, long-term
factors are greater. As a social institution, a commons is also more
likely to care about the long-term sustainability of a resource than the
market, because the very identities and cultures of the commoners are
wrapped up in the management of the resource" (2014:110). Ostrom's
findings about the commons contradicted dominant Western ideologies
articulated by Garrett Hardin
(]{.CharOverride-1}https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrett\_Hardin[) in
his influential essay, "The Tragedy of the Commons" (1968). Hardin
offered a parable of a group of shepherds grazing sheep on a common
pasture wherein every shepherd will inevitably increase his number of
animals because while the cost of his adding each animal is distributed
among all the shepherds, the benefit is his alone. Hardin's parable
suggested that, in the absence of the incentives of individualized
private property or the sanctions of centralized government authorities,
humans in communities are inherently selfish, short sighted, and
incapable of using resources sustainably over the long term.
]{.CharOverride-1}

[H]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ardin's argument was a cogent
and relatively recent manifestation of a longstanding line of thought
regarding land management. Translated into policy, including the
appropriation and enclosure of Native American prairie commons and the
increasing scale, mechanization, and corporatization of Midwestern
agriculture, this line of thought has led to a century and a half of
private and government mismanagement of the prairies. Indeed, it has led
to their near elimination and destruction as described in Connie Mutel's
masterful treatise on the prairies, ]{.CharOverride-1}[The Emerald
Horizon: The History of Nature in Iowa
]{.CharOverride-2}(https://www.uipress.uiowa.edu/books/9781587296321/the-emerald-horizon)[.
However, the recent history of the prairies is not only one of
destruction and mismanagement. In her book, Mutel also documents
multiple public and private initiatives to preserve and restore the
prairies, but none of them takes the form of the community-based commons
approach that characterizes Dancing Rabbit. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[I]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[n this article, I explore two
decades of common property management and community building on the
Missouri prairie by the members of Dancing Rabbit. My aims here are
twofold. First, I wish to show how a group of ecovillagers is
demonstrating that effective commons management is possible today on at
least a small portion of the North American prairie. Second, I wish to
explore their efforts to simultaneously restore prairie ecosystems and
develop productive human landscapes through cooperative stewardship of
their collectively held acreage.]{.CharOverride-1}

[Dancing Rabbit Ecovillage]{.CharOverride-50}

[D]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ancing Rabbit is an intentional
community of approximately 60 people, founded in the mid-1990s in
Scotland County, northeast Missouri. The nomenclature "ecovillage" is
used by many contemporary intentional communities to define their
collective identity and indicate their shared commitment to living in
more ecologically sustainable ways. The term first appeared in the
1970s, but its popularization is most commonly attributed to a report
called "Ecovillages and Sustainable Communities" which was written by
Robert and Diane Gilman for the charitable organization Gaia Trust
(]{.CharOverride-1}https://gaia.org[) in the early 1990s. In that
report, the Gilmans defined an ecovillage as "A human scale,
full-featured settlement in which human activities are harmlessly
integrated into the natural world in a way that is supportive of healthy
human development and can be successfully continued into the indefinite
future" (cited in Dawson 2006:13). This definition has since been
revised and added to multiple times. On its website, the Global
Ecovillage Network (]{.CharOverride-1}https://ecovillage.org[), an
organization that helps ecovillages around the world network with one
another, states that "\[a\]n ecovillage is an intentional, traditional
or urban community that is consciously designed through locally owned,
participatory processes in all four dimensions of sustainability
(social, culture, ecology, economy into a whole systems design) to
regenerate its social and natural environment." In general, deliberate,
collaborative, multi-dimensional approaches to living in more
ecologically sustainable manners are defining features of ecovillages,
especially in more affluent countries of the world. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[F]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[rom the beginning, the Rabbits
adopted this mission statement: "To create a society, the size of a
small town or village, made up of individuals and communities of various
sizes and social structures, which allows and encourages its members to
live sustainably. To encourage this sustainable society to grow to have
the size and recognition necessary to have an influence on the global
community by example, education, and research". The community includes
the local ecosystem in its definition of the term 'sustainable'. As the
community's mission statement goes on to state, living sustainably
involves living "in such a manner that, within the defined area, no
resources are consumed faster than their natural replenishment, and the
enclosed system can continue indefinitely without degradation of its
internal resource base or the standard of living of the people and the
rest of the ecosystem within it." Deliberately situating themselves
relative to both the local and the global, both the human and the
other-than-human, is a defining feature of these Rabbits' commons
endeavor. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[F]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[or the last decade, I have been
part of a team of researchers that has been working with the Rabbits to
help them assess their progress toward sustainable living. We have done
this by measuring their consumption of resources and their experienced
well-being, and comparing these measures with those of mainstream
American society. Our results indicate that, in many key areas, they are
living on about 10 percent of the resources used by the average
American, while maintaining about the same experienced quality of life
\[see Lockyer 2017
(]{.CharOverride-1}https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/JPE/article/view/20890/20480[)\]
for a full analysis and interpretation of our results.]{.CharOverride-1}

[A]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[s part of this work, I also
turned my attention to the community's land use and land management
practices, along with the ways in which the community is transforming
its collectively held landscape. One of the community's goals is to
restore a parcel of degraded farmland as a functioning prairie ecosystem
that is able to sustainably provide for many of their needs while also
creating habitat for the many other-than-human prairie inhabitants that
used to be so ubiquitous here. In this article, I make no attempt to
quantitatively measure their progress either at providing for their own
needs from their land or at restoring prairie ecosystems; rather, my aim
is simply to describe their efforts to steward their land.
]{.CharOverride-1}

[D]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ancing Rabbit's approach to land
management and intentional community-building is what Bollier and others
call an act of "commoning". Like the members of most contemporary
intentional communities, the Rabbits are activating the power of social
cooperation to build community, achieve goals, and manage resources.
Dancing Rabbit's commons system is manifested via a number of
components. These include a community land trust model which replaces
individualized speculation on land for short term economic profit with
collective stewardship of land for long term ecological sustainability.
It also includes a community governance system where, through a variety
of forums and processes of grassroots democracy, people work together to
make decisions about and develop policies pertaining to use of the land
they own together. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[D]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ancing Rabbit's land is
collectively owned and managed through a 501(c)2 land trust and an
associated 501(c)3 research and education nonprofit. Both of these
organizations are overseen by a board of directors (on which I serve),
but the day-to-day management of land and community rests primarily with
the Rabbits who live on the land. The whole community makes decisions
and formulates rules concerning land use, including the long-term
leasing of individual land parcels to individuals or small groups within
the community for residences, businesses, and food production. As their
website says: "The land trust model takes land out of the speculative
market while still providing an ownership-like option for our members.
Each individual or household can lease a small plot of land for a
monthly fee. ...Leaseholders do not own their land, but do own any
improvements on their land, including any buildings, orchards, gardens,
etc. These can be sold to another member if someone leaves the community
or moves to a different leasehold. Since members can't sell their land,
there is no ability to speculate and land can be a permanently
affordable resource..." ]{.CharOverride-1}(Danc­ing Rabbit Ecovillage
2015)[. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[F]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[urther, each leasehold is
designed and used according to a collaborative ecological design
process: "Each new leasehold must go through a community approval
process. The community attempts to guide new members through an
ecological design process to make sure they are taking into account both
the needs of their household or garden and the effects it will have on
their neighbors and our land. Our goal is to allow great flexibility for
each member to realize their vision of a sustainable dwelling or garden
while also fitting their goals into the larger design goals of the
village." (Dancing Rabbit Ecovillage 2015). The community balances many
priorities in its approach to using and managing the landscape with long
term, collective sustainability deliberately taking precedence over
short-term, individualized profit.]{.CharOverride-1}

[A]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[s the community's population has
grown, its governance system has evolved, from full group consensus
decision making to a representative village council whose members render
decisions and sometimes delegate deliberation to committees, which in
turn report back to the council or community as a whole. There is also a
land use planning and policy component, overseen by a committee that,
with community feedback, designs land use rules. In addition, the
community reserves several days a year for a retreat where all community
members gather to discuss and update community issues, including its
relationship with its land. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[he overall goal is to give
community members ample opportunity to actively participate in
management of commonly held resources. This is an ongoing process of
learning, experimenting, and adjusting their practices to achieve
desirable results relative to the Rabbits' overarching mission and
goals: "to design a resource-minimizing and community-promoting,
pedestrian-scaled village that minimizes our footprint on our land to
leave space for agriculture and wildlife habitat."
]{.CharOverride-1}(Dancing Rabbit Ecovillage 2018)

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[o balance community-building and
the meeting of human needs with long-term sustainable land management,
Dancing Rabbit has adopted a number of initiatives and areas of focus.
These include dense urban design, agricultural production and
development, and prairie ecosystem restoration and reforestation.
]{.CharOverride-1}

[Urban Development]{.CharOverride-50}

[A]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[s Connie Mutel indicates in
]{.CharOverride-1}[The Emerald Horizon]{.CharOverride-2}[, the parceling
of prairie landscapes into individualized portions for agriculture and
urban development has been a key driver of the prairie ecosystem
destruction. When Dancing Rabbit acquired its acreage in the mid-1990s,
the land was a post-industrial farmscape that had not been farmed for
over ten years and included only a few buildings left over from previous
decades of industrial farming. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[I]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[n order to allow the majority of
the community's land to heal, the Rabbits agreed to build their
community infrastructure on only a small portion of their land. Current
urban development is contained within approximately twenty acres, with
plans to expand to forty acres (see Figure 4). In the early years, the
challenge was simply to provide housing, but throughout Dancing Rabbit's
history, community members have paid attention not only to their
physical footprint on their land, but also to the embedded energy
contained in the building materials they use. In addition to having a
small geographic footprint, houses are constructed using a variety of
natural and green building techniques, often incorporating locally
available materials such as straw bales, clay, and reclaimed lumber. As
a result, a dense cluster of eclectic buildings has grown up on the
southeast corner of the land. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[hrough its land use planning and
leaseholding process, the community continues to update and revise
policies regarding the use of space, including the placement of foot and
cart paths (vehicles are kept on the village perimeter, except under
exceptional circumstances, often involving construction), the
orientation of buildings to roads and to each other, and the
incorporation of green space into the urban area. The overall aim is to
create a densely populated urban village on one small corner of the
acreage. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[P]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[lanning for the development of a
commons in a way that considers the needs of both current and future
residents is, as the community's website indicates "\[a\]n ongoing
challenge," given "the tension between overarching design and organic
growth." The website cites "\[the\] need to have a plan for the future
that holds our values and vision, while also meeting the needs of the
current community members. It can be tricky at times to plug each
individual's or family's vision into the village plan and still promote
the long term patterns for growth we are hoping for."
]{.CharOverride-1}(Dancing Rabbit Ecovillage 2015) [This tension between
growth and development on the one hand and sustainable use on the other
lies at the heart of the challenge of successful commoning. It will be
interesting to see how the Rabbits address this challenge as their
community grows over coming years. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[Agricultural Development]{.CharOverride-50}

[A]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[s the Rabbits increasingly met
their needs for shelter during the early years, many of them were able
to turn their focus to producing food for themselves and their
community. This has entailed rehabilitating land that, while fallow
since 1987, was degraded by decades of industrial corn and hog farming.
In addition to residential leaseholds, the community has garden
leaseholds where people produce food for the households and the kitchen
cooperatives they are part of, as well as commercial agricultural
leaseholds where people produce food for sale to their fellow community
members and residents of surrounding areas. Currently, the members of
the village have designated fifty acres for food production, much of
which is yet to be developed.]{.CharOverride-1}

[F]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ood produced using standard
industrial methods employed on private property, but organized according
to policies designed by centralized state governments, has been one of
the main drivers of unsustainable use of prairie landscapes. In
contrast, Ostrom and her colleagues have documented more sustainable
land use practices and food production systems in many successful
commons institutions. At Dancing Rabbit, agricultural development
proceeds according to models much more in the latter vein than in the
former. The scale of production at Dancing Rabbit is smaller and more
diverse, often integrating multiple species into a field and sometimes,
as in the case of forest gardens, integrating wild and domesticated
species into the same plot. Permaculture, a design philosophy for human
food production that is based on working with natural forces rather than
against them, underlies many Rabbits' approach to food production. While
such systems have the direct and immediate benefit of producing food for
people, they are also designed with an eye to interconnections and
indirect benefits such as fostering habitat for wildlife that may be
hunted, and to restoring soil fertility over the long-term.
]{.CharOverride-1}

[A ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[small number of Rabbits
incorporate rotational grazing into their approach to food production
and land management. While many Rabbits choose to be vegan or vegetarian
as part of their sustainable living philosophy, a number of them
recognize that prairie ecosystems are particularly appropriate contexts
for the production of animal protein. They deliberately use animal
agriculture in an attempt to mimic the role of grazing herbivores such
as bison in the Pre-Colombian prairies. It is here that the Rabbits'
approach to food production overlaps with their efforts at prairie
ecosystem restoration. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[Prairie Ecosystem Restoration]{.CharOverride-50}

[O]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[f Dancing Rabbit's 280 total
acres, 160 acres are managed through the federal government's
Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). Administered by the Farm Service
Agency, CRP pays farmers and landowners to remove environmentally
sensitive tracts of land from agricultural production with the goals of
improving water quality, preventing soil erosion, and preventing the
loss of wildlife habitat. Most of Dancing Rabbit's efforts at prairie
ecosystem restoration are undertaken on its CRP acreage.
]{.CharOverride-1}

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[hus, in addition to categories
of land specifically set aside for urban development and agriculture,
Dancing Rabbit has a category of land labelled 'Prioritized for
Ecosystem Health'. Land management which prioritizes ecosystem health is
part of the community's efforts to balance the needs of the human and
other-than-human inhabitants of their land. According to the community's
website, "This is the area in which we will encourage and assist in
ecosystem health, stability and resiliency. This area consists of all
Dancing Rabbit property not... \[designated for urban or agricultural
development\]. We expect to establish native species, stabilize soil,
encourage diversity and control invasive non-native species.... We've
planted native grasses on over 15 acres and have been maintaining them
with regular prescribed burns, an essential part of the prairie's life
cycle. We hope to rebuild the diversity of plots by replanting patches
of the few native wildflowers and grasses that can still be found in
northeast Missouri. While we do not work directly on wildlife management
of native animals, our land provides a sanctuary from the expanding
farms, roads and towns elsewhere." ]{.CharOverride-1}(Dancing Rabbit
Ecovillage 2015)

[D]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ancing Rabbit members have
undertaken to inform themselves about their land's history and the
destructive transformation of the North American prairies in general.
The community's common library includes dozens of books focused on
related subjects, and the community's approach to healing the land is a
frequent topic of conversation. During an interview with me as part of
our research project, one community member described a meeting with a
long-time local farmer who informed him that Dancing Rabbit's land was
"probably the most over-grazed, over-farmed piece of land in the
county." For many decades, the land was used for industrial scale
commodity food production, primarily for corn and hogs, which eliminated
most natural components of the prairies and degraded the soil. Studies
of attempts to allow prairies to recover from industrial farming show
that prairies can be so degraded, they often only further degenerate
when left to the natural succession process; prairies require human
intervention for successful conservation and restoration (Mutel 2008).
Dancing Rabbit therefore desires to actively steward the healing of the
land rather than passively abandon it to natural processes of
succession. While not all Rabbits agree on the best approach to doing
this, the community's land-use planning committee and Dancing Rabbit's
forums for collective governance provide venues for decision making
about the community's continuously evolving approach to prairie
stewardship and restoration, which at this writing includes in-progress
restoration of over 15 acres of native grasslands. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[A]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[nother collective initiative
undertaken by Rabbits, with the aim of restoring prairie ecosystem
health and expanding native biodiversity, involves reforestation.
Original prairies in this part of the country included oak-dominated
woodlands, especially along watercourses, where the effects of natural
and man-made fire were minimized and where more moisture was available
(Mutel 2008). These woodlands were cut back as industrial agricultural
fields expanded, starting especially in the mid-twentieth century. Over
the years, the Rabbits have planted over 15,000 individual trees of
species native to the prairies while also removing invasive woody
species by using controlled burns and other methods.]{.CharOverride-1}

[O]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ne Da]{.CharOverride-1}ncing
Rabbit member who is heavily involved in the land use planning committee
has estimated that the community is gaining, on average, an acre of
forest each year through the expansion of remnant woodlands and the
maturation of tree plantings. This has resulted in some of Dancing
Rabbit's land falling out of eligibility for the Conservation Reserve
Program, as forested land is not in a condition to go back into
agricultural production.

[D]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[uring my visi]{.CharOverride-1}t
to Dancing Rabbit in the summer of 2018, it became clear that
unprecedented drought conditions were driving decisions that would have
unforeseen impacts on the community's efforts at prairie ecosystem
restoration. In July 2018, the community granted a neighboring farmer's
request to use tractors to produce desperately needed hay for his cattle
from the 160 acres of land which the community had allocated to the
Conservation Reserve Program. Some community members were dubious about
the impact this would have on their ecosystem restoration efforts, while
others suggested that such haying might actually do a

[better job of removing invasive species than would the community's
infrequent controlled burns. Whatever the case, this recent development
in the community's relationship with its land drives home two points
that I wish to make as I move toward my conclusions.]{.CharOverride-1}

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[he impacts of global climate
change will undoubtedly introduce unpredictable variables into efforts
to restore prairie ecosystems, whether at Dancing Rabbit Ecovillage or
elsewhere. Furthermore, while the Rabbits do their best to
systematically monitor the outcomes of their landscape management
endeavors, they are exceptionally busy with making a living for
themselves and would benefit from more involvement by qualified
scientists who have expertise in these areas. Concurrently, scientists
also stand to gain through analysis of what is a living experiment in
land management and prairie ecosystem restoration. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[Discussion]{.CharOverride-50}

[D]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[uring two centuries of
Euro-American colonization, the prairies were largely destroyed through
processes of agricultural and urban development. The community at
Dancing Rabbit Ecovillage is trying to restore a small portion of the
prairies while also producing food and developing an urban area on its
parcel of degraded prairie farmland. The community's practices of
agricultural and urban development, quite different from those so
predominantly employed elsewhere in the prairie region, are worthy of
closer examination and analysis. In its almost twenty years of
existence, Dancing Rabbit has made significant changes in the
surrounding physical landscape. Through cooperative and individual
endeavor, a mostly uninhabited 280-acre tract of degraded farmland has
become a patchwork of regenerating prairie ecosystems, a developing
urban area, and a variety of edible landscapes. All of these changes
have taken place as the community used a land trust model and grassroots
democracy to manage its collective relationship with the landscape while
conducting an experiment in common property stewardship.
]{.CharOverride-1}

[H]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ow successful has Dancing Rabbit
been in its aims to transform its landscape into a restored, diverse
prairie ecosystem while also engaging in productive activities that met
human needs? The current answer is almost certainly "only partially."
However, just as the destruction of the prairies was a long-term
project, so will be their restoration. As a researcher and Dancing
Rabbit board member with long-term familiarity with the community, I aim
to help develop future collaborative research projects at the community.
Such projects may include helping them to monitor ecological
restoration---soil testing, grass, flower, & tree species inventories,
and wildlife monitoring, among other activities directly relevant to
prairie ecosystem restoration. At the same time, we will continue to
monitor if and how the Rabbits are able to meet their needs from the
land in sustainable ways that lessen their impact on ecosystems
elsewhere. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[H]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ow much food, fuel, fiber, and
building materials are they able to harvest from the land, while
continuing their efforts toward prairie ecosystem restoration? Can the
Rabbits find a sustainable balance between development for a growing
community and ecological restoration? Only time will tell, but I hope
that ongoing research can lend a crucial hand in helping the community
achieve its goals and demonstrate that people in modern western
societies can still find ways to cooperatively and sustainably manage
the commons. Scientists with relevant expertise who are interested in
undertaking research at Dancing Rabbit are encouraged to contact me at

[Conclusion]{.CharOverride-50}

[I]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}['d like to close with a
quotation from Wendell Berry
(]{.CharOverride-1}https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendell\_Berry[), a
poet, farmer, professor and philosopher who has spent much of his life
reflecting on what is required for a healthy relationship between people
and land in American culture, and particularly in the agricultural
Midwest. Although Berry uses the term 'local culture' in this quotation,
I think he is really talking about a 'local commons' such as the one
Dancing Rabbit is creating. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[he loss of local culture is, in
part, a practical loss and an economic one. For one thing, such a
culture contains, and conveys to succeeding generations, the history of
the use of the place and the knowledge of how the place may be lived in
and used. For another, the patterns of reminding implies affection for
the place and respect for it, and so, finally, the local culture will
carry the knowledge of how the place may be well and lovingly used, and
also the implicit command to use it only well and lovingly. The only
true and effective 'operator's manual for spaceship earth' is not a book
that any human will ever write; it is hundreds of thousands of local
cultures. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[W]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[endell Berry 1990:
166.]{.CharOverride-1}

[D]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ancing Rabbit is only in the
beginning stages of creating its local commons. The community's acts of
commoning involve developing knowledge, respect, and affection for its
place and its landscape so that it may be lived in "well and lovingly
used" across the generations. Conducting research at Dancing Rabbit over
the last ten years, I have seen this creation emerging in the way
community members spend time deliberately observing, interacting with,
learning from, and stewarding both their landscape and their community.
I see it in the fact that they often name their buildings after native
prairie species that may disappear if their habitats are not restored.
But perhaps the best measure of their success or failure in creating a
local commons will only be revealed in the actions and choices of the
younger generation currently being raised in this community and on its
common land. ]{.CharOverride-1}

In July of 2018, [Rootstock]{.CharOverride-24} Associate Editor Vincent
Benlloch spoke with Matt and Sarah Kargol, founders of the non-profit
Fine Arts and Cultural Events (FACE) of Mahaska County, Iowa
(https://www.faceofmahaska.com), housed at Oskaloosa's Art Center and
Studios (https://www.facebook.com/oskaloosaartcenter).

[Matt Kargol ]{.CharOverride-6}[(http://www.matthewkargolart.com) is a
sculptor and native of Oskaloosa, Iowa, where ]{.CharOverride-2}[he
teaches Art]{.CharOverride-37}[ ]{.CharOverride-37}[at the local high
schoo]{.CharOverride-37}[l]{.CharOverride-37}[. ]{.CharOverride-2}

[Sarah Kargol]{.CharOverride-6}[
(https://www.facebook.com/art.by.sarah.kargol) ]{.CharOverride-2}[was
born in Colorado and raised in eastern Iowa. She received her bachelor's
degree in studio art from the University of Northern Iowa in 2000, and
is ]{.CharOverride-37}[an
]{.CharOverride-2}[award-winning]{.CharOverride-37}[ mixed media artist
]{.CharOverride-2}[with artwork in permanent collections throughout the
Midwest and Southeast United States and Canada. ]{.CharOverride-37}

Speaking about her process, she says: "In developing my own voice
through art, my love for ephemera and all things dusty, forgotten,
vintage, and quirky has grown. I create small pieces and individual
parts out of these papers, fabrics, and threads from society's past
treasures and assembling them together. Layering them with other
individual pieces and parts opens up new conversations about some of our
shared humanity's weirdest and worst ideas and highlights our beautiful
collective movement forward."

[ Sarah is ]{.CharOverride-37}[co-founder of the Oskaloosa Art Center
and Studios and serves as the Director of the center, where she
coordinates classes and events. She also serves as a board member of
Fine Arts and Cultural Events of Mahaska County (FACE), which aims to
]{.CharOverride-2}["provide exceptional arts education and opportunities
in order to make art accessible and exciting to our community."
]{.CharOverride-37}

The couple met while at University of Northern Iowa
(http://www.uni.edu). After spending three years in the South pursuing
their artistic careers, they decided to return to Matt's hometown to
raise their four boys.

Upon arriving, they discovered that their new, rural community in the
heart of Mahaska County had a void they felt they could fill. We talked
with them on a summer afternoon about how they've been trying to do just
that over the past two years.

[R]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-47}[ootstalk:]{.CharOverride-47}[
We]{.CharOverride-1}['d be curious to hear a little more about what's
going on in Oskaloosa
(]{.CharOverride-26}[h]{.CharOverride-1}[ttps://www.oskaloosaiowa.org)
right now for you, what programs you're offering, and the trajectory for
your work.]{.CharOverride-26}

[Sarah:]{.CharOverride-18} We opened the art center four years ago on
the east side of town, and for the most part I think it was a successful
endeavor. I know for a fact that Oskaloosa never had an art center
before, ever in its history, which kind of surprised me. We opened up a
brick and mortar space where we could offer classes and whatnot, and
about a year and a half or almost two years ago this space was offered
to us by Musco Lighting \[a multinational company headquartered in
Oskaloosa; http://www.musco.com\]. \[Musco CEO\] Joe Crookham knew that
we needed a better location, something where more residents would know
that we have this kind of service available. They renovated this
building and donated all their labor and materials, and we opened a year
ago last April. It's just been a killer year. It's been just amazing. I
think people now can happen by us and kind of discover that we have an
art center and find out what kinds of things the art center can offer
the community. We have lots of classes and activities, and different
events for everybody.

[Matt:]{.CharOverride-18} We have the gallery shows.

[Sarah:]{.CharOverride-18} Yeah, we have a gallery, classrooms,
ceramics, and printmaking. This outer space area that we're in is where
we do performances and open mic nights where people can come and do
whatever they want on the stage[---]{.CharOverride-1}you know, family
friendly.

[Matt]{.CharOverride-18}[:]{.CharOverride-33} Oskaloosa Community
Theater (http://oskytheater.blogspot.com) comes and performs here.

[ Sarah: ]{.CharOverride-18}Yes, they do. We also put up a temporary
wall where people can come and hang up their art for a night during
"Open Wall/Open Stage" once a month. I think that it's beneficial to get
people to put their art in front of people, I think that's a big step.
We're just super excited about the growth that's taken place in the last
year. Especially with this sculpture tour that's happening and the
things the Art Center is doing, like our involvement with the city as we
implement our public art plan.

[Matt]{.CharOverride-18}[:]{.CharOverride-33} We've got the sculpture
studio that we're working on getting open too.

[Sarah: ]{.CharOverride-18}The art center is expanding, so we've been
allowed use of another building down the street on A Avenue. That will
be our sculpture annex. We'll be teaching three dimensional classes
there like metal fabrication, welding, I'm not sure if we'll do any
woodworking there because of the welding, you don't want that fire
hazard, but we might offer some wood classes, we'll see. We're hoping
that we outgrow that space quickly and are able to offer glass blowing
or move the ceramics classes that way. So more three dimensional that
way and two dimensional in this space.

[Matt]{.CharOverride-18}[:]{.CharOverride-33} One of the cool things
with the art center and the sculpture annex is that people in the
community will not only be able to learn how to do these things, but
will then have a facility where they can do these things. It's really
hard to set up a studio yourself. You need equipment that costs a lot
and takes up a lot of room. Having that space where people can have
studio time and just come and create it will be pretty unique in Iowa. I
don't know if there is another sculpture community or sculpture studio
in the whole state.

[Sarah: ]{.CharOverride-18} So, that's our trajectory. We have big
plans. Probably bigger than we can chew off by ourselves, and we know
that but I think the bigger we think and the bigger we dream, the bigger
strides we make here in Oskaloosa.

[Matt:]{.CharOverride-18} I think the biggest thing we need right now is
to increase our people-power.

[Sarah:]{.CharOverride-18}[ ]{.CharOverride-33}Our volunteer base is
very small.

[Matt: ]{.CharOverride-18}We need more people involved. The more people
we can get involved, the more things we can make happen. When we have
five to seven people doing everything you can only do so much. If we
could get 20 people, that impact just magnifies.

[Rootstalk:]{.CharOverride-33} You mentioned this public art plan. How
are you connecting with local funding sources or how are you planning to
implement it?

[Sarah: ]{.CharOverride-18}When we moved to Oskaloosa we noticed there
was kind of an art void. Matt is looking at things from a bigger
perspective, I don't know, he's got this huge dream for Oskaloosa. I'm
talking huge, like this is going to be an art mecca someday. What he did
was he actually sat down and wrote a public art plan for the city's
use[---]{.CharOverride-1}but it didn't go that way, so we're holding on
to it and using it ourselves.

[Matt:]{.CharOverride-18}[ ]{.CharOverride-33}There's a lot of elements
to it, and really, the sculpture tour is the first step in that. For the
sculpture tour we were able to get seed money[---]{.CharOverride-1}grant
money from the Golden Goose club here in town[---]{.CharOverride-1}which
is a hundred women who put a hundred dollars down each quarter to fund a
specific event.

[Sarah: ]{.CharOverride-18}It's just a grassroots group of women that
just pull their money and then vote on where it goes in their community.
For example, we got seed money for the sculpture tour, but the next time
I think the police got new body cameras. They fund all types of stuff in
Oskaloosa. I think it's a unique group and it's a really amazing funding
source.

[Matt: ]{.CharOverride-18}Now, the impact on the community is huge.
People come to Oskaloosa now and go, wow, this is an art community
because there's art around.

We call it the sculpture tour and it really does act like a tour. If
someone were to go to each location of a sculpture they would learn a
lot about the community because the sculptures are placed in locations
where there's significant history. Those are places that you wouldn't go
to if you didn't know there was history there but you start to learn
about the community that way. It really helps engage the community and
visitors too. So that's the first step.

[Sarah: ]{.CharOverride-18}Phase one!

[Matt: ]{.CharOverride-18}Phase one. We're looking at murals on
buildings, also some street murals. There's just a whole list of stuff
that we want to do, but you know, we've got to take it in steps and make
sure our funding sources are secure for what we're doing before we add
something else to it.

[Rootstalk:]{.CharOverride-33}[ ]{.CharOverride-18}You mentioned there
was an art void here. We're curious[---]{.CharOverride-1}with the
schools and the local education system here, how does this connect with
education? Do you get any support from either high schools or middle
schools, or William Penn University (https://www.wmpenn.edu)? Have you
been able to draw them in?

[Matt: ]{.CharOverride-18}We're trying to draw them in. With me teaching
at the high school, I give additional credit for going to art openings
and participating in these things. There's art in the classroom and then
there's art out in the community that's happening. We do stuff in the
classroom and we learn, and that's great, but then there's this whole
art world that we're trying to create here and that we're trying to
bring to Oskaloosa. Having those experiences is different than sitting
in the classroom. I grew up here and I loved art and I went to school
for art, but I went to college having never been to an art gallery. It
wasn't available to me. So when I moved back here to teach, that was one
of my goals[---]{.CharOverride-1}to make sure these kids can't say they
didn't have that opportunity, so that the opportunity now exists.

When we first changed out some of the sculptures we were in the square
watching, and there were some people walking down the street and they
stopped and were looking at all the sculptures and they were talking. I
have no idea what they were saying, but that was a conversation that
wouldn't have happened otherwise. It sparked something. I don't know if
they liked it or disliked it, but that doesn't really matter. The fact
is that they were contemplating something that they wouldn't have
contemplated before and so their world has expanded.

[Rootstalk:]{.CharOverride-33}[ ]{.CharOverride-18}We're curious what
each of your individual philosophies or approaches to art are both in
your practice and in your work in the community? How has that changed or
developed as you've been working here?

[Matt: ]{.CharOverride-18}Having the support of the art center has made
me kind of get with the game a bit more and get in the studio a bit, you
know, because it's available. Before I was working out of a one car
garage with all my stuff and I couldn't use half of it. Now that I have
a space to work it's a lot more convenient.

When we moved here, we'd been in a lot of other towns. We'd been in
Clemson, South Carolina but we had a studio in Greenville, SC.
Greenville has done a whole re-development based on the arts. It's been
rated one of the most beautiful cities in the South, and it is
beautiful. They've developed the riverfront with art studios. So there's
a hotel and restaurants up above, but it's all studios along the river
and it's just beautiful. They've really embraced their artists. They
have art walks, they have studio tours, they have all this stuff and
coming from an environment where there's a good number of artists to a
place where there really wasn't.

There's not that community here. That's part of my vision, is that we
keep building our facilities up so that artists are going to want to be
here. I know when I graduated from college there was no way I could've
set up a studio myself. You don't have the resources to do that. But if
you could come to Oskaloosa, and you're a sculptor and there's already a
studio set up then you can kind of integrate into that. This is a great
place to get started. It's fairly cheap to live here, you got a studio
to work from, and then we're starting to build that community.

[Sarah: ]{.CharOverride-18}My perspective from the art center point of
view was a little different. I work with a lot of youth, a lot of young
kids. I think that's going to help, you know not immediately, but it's
building a population that appreciates art, does art, and knows that
it's valuable in all sorts of ways, educationally or emotionally art is
just a good thing. I don't want to put down my town
here[---]{.CharOverride-1}so be careful with what you
write[---]{.CharOverride-1}but I know that Oskaloosa isn't too educated
on the arts. And I feel like our focus on education and exposure is
going to help. Especially this next generation that's coming up. Maybe
\[art is\] not going to be this foreign thing. The longer we're here,
the more of an impact we're going to have. This is a safe space.

[Matt:]{.CharOverride-18} I like to think we've given a home to a lot of
kids where they can feel comfortable. There's people, not just kids,
that go through all kinds of things in their lives and sometimes the
world is kind of cruel and not accepting of people who maybe are a
little different. Art is all about being different. We've really found
that a lot of the community who sometimes is on the fringe have really
embraced the art center and made it their second home. A lot of kids
who'll just come and hang out and it's like, "ok, man, that's cool."

I do sculptures so I'm always trying to balance what I do. I like to do
big stuff but big stuff is hard to move, and hard to sell, and hard to
do stuff with. There's constant struggle there when I want to make big
stuff but then I realize I've got to make smaller stuff and when I can
put it on the wall that's even better because people have space on
walls, they don't necessarily have space out in the three dimensional
world. So, those are things that always push and pull me with my art.
With the sculpture too, I wanted to have a place where I could also show
my work. You know, if I can't show my work in my own town then it's a
problem. It wasn't necessarily about me, but it was about....

[Sarah: ]{.CharOverride-18}It was about a passion!

[Matt: ]{.CharOverride-18} I love sculptures, and if I love it, somebody
else was going to love it.

[Sarah: ]{.CharOverride-18}And people do.

[Matt: ]{.CharOverride-18}So we might as well share it.

[Sarah: ]{.CharOverride-18}I think that's key to what's going on in
Oskaloosa. I don't want to point at one person, but he's been this push
for the art center, he's been the push for the sculpture tour, our
public art plan. He's been the guy who's like, "this is what we need,"
so he lights the fire under us, under our board or gives us something to
chew on so we can move forward in what we provide the community. So
Matt's passion for 3D or metal fabrication or any sort of sculpture
really has fueled getting the art center going, this sculpture annex
going, the sculpture tour, I mean all of it. I want to say we've all
worked together to get this going and up off the ground but Matt's
really been the ignition point.

[Matt:]{.CharOverride-18} Going forward, we want to start a residency
program because we only can teach so many things to people who are in
this community, we only know how to teach so many things.

There's artists doing all kinds of wonderful things, and if we can bring
them here for a couple weeks, a month, a few months, however it works
out and they could work through the art center, teach a class here and
there, do their practice, that just exposes our community to more
opportunities and more ways of working that we can't necessarily give
them right now. I do metal fabrication sculpture work, I don't do
figurative bronze work. I wouldn't have a clue. That's something that I
know people in the community identify with as sculpture, these
figurative bronzes-realistic-type-things, that you make out of clay and
then cast. We need to bring in an artist who does that, so that it's
something we can get started. Once people learn it then they can develop
it here and we can keep bringing people back.

[Rootstalk:]{.CharOverride-33} You mentioned that you're from Oskaloosa
originally\....

[Sarah:]{.CharOverride-18} I grew up in the Cedar Rapids area, actually.
I moved there when I was eight, and I was born in Colorado, but I don't
really remember that. We met at University of Northern Iowa, in our
Education class, and got married shortly after that.

[Matt:]{.CharOverride-18} We both went to UNI. Then I taught at
different places.

[Sarah: ]{.CharOverride-18}Taught high school.

[Matt:]{.CharOverride-18} Taught high school. And then went back to
graduate school after I got my BA and MA at UNI. Then I went to graduate
school at Clemson University. Got my MFA there. Then I taught in South
Dakota for four years which was very....

[Sarah: ]{.CharOverride-18}It was difficult in a lot of ways.

[Matt:]{.CharOverride-18} It was difficult. It didn't match us very
well. So then I resigned from there and we went and did art full time
for three years.

[Sarah: ]{.CharOverride-18}I'm a mixed media artist, and I was doing
really well, really well. And then we moved down to South Carolina in
2009 which is when the market just bottomed out. We did art full time
for three years which was... and I tell people this... it was great and
at the same time the hardest thing I'd ever done.

[Matt:]{.CharOverride-18} It was the best of times, it was the worst of
times....

[ Sarah: ]{.CharOverride-18}It's really true. We had four kids and no
money. The power kept getting shut off, Christmas presents were being
donated to us, I mean it was really difficult with the kids, but at the
same time we were doing, you know, what we were put on this earth to do,
which is to make art and bring beauty into the world. So we had to make
a tough choice then.

So Matt came out one day and said his old high school art teacher was
retiring and he asked if he should apply, and I was like, "I don't want
to move to Oskaloosa, but if you want to apply, it's not like we would
have to move there." He applied, and then he got an interview. I was
like, "just interview it's not like you have to take the job." But then
he interviewed, and they offered him the job, so when someone offers you
a job and you don't have food in the fridge, you kind of have to take
it, right? Especially with our children. We wanted to set a good example
for them, that's why we went and did art full time. We wanted to say,
"look, you can follow your dreams, you can be who you want to be or who
you're made to be in this world," but it wasn't that easy.

[Matt:]{.CharOverride-18} You know, we're artists. Artists need a
community to work from and to work around other artists and creative
people. It's interesting because I always think of myself as an artist
first and then I teach after that or I advocate for the arts or I do all
these other things, but I'm always an artist first. And then I look at
some of my artist friends who all they do is art, and I've never been
able to just do art, I've always done these other things to try and
build the arts, and I don't know where that comes from. I don't know,
it's just part of how I operate, I guess. I guess it's because when you
realize that art is so great, you want to share that, you want to make
sure that everyone understands that, knows how wonderful it is. And when
you look around and realize no one else is doing it or only a few people
are doing it, you realize: if someone's going do it, it's going be me.

[Sarah: ]{.CharOverride-18}Right. See a need, fill a need. There was a
definite need here, so we jumped in.

Born in the Midwest at nearly the
exact middle of the 20th Century, Dartanyan Brown has been
front-and-center for many of American culture's most defining struggles,
particularly the Civil Rights movement and the advent of revolutions in
music and technology. Where many people content themselves with one
career, Brown has had at least four: in journalism, in musical
performance, in the tech sector and in education. Through it all, he has
continued to forge ahead with an optimism and openness to connection
that he learned in a family guided by a strong maternal grandmother who
grew up in an integrated Iowa town where she "didn't know nothin' 'bout
no segregation!" ]{.CharOverride-52}

Integrated Life. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[Buxton Roots]{.CharOverride-54}

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[o begin, let's travel back in
time 122 years ago to a coal seam in Monroe County, Iowa, owned by the
Consolidation Coal Co. of Chicago. The town that grew up around the
mine, Buxton]{.CharOverride-26}[2]{.CharOverride-55}[ (near present day
Albia), was named eponymously for its manager, Ben C. Buxton. That was
where my great-grandparents, Ross and Blanche Johnson, arrived from
Virginia in 1895. Why did they travel so far?]{.CharOverride-26}

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[o understand why my grandparents
and other African Americans perceived Iowa as a place of refuge, we have
to understand the conditions they endured in 1890's Virginia. In the
year 1894, African Americans were actually the majority of the
population of Albemarle County, Virginia. (The county was home to 606
free Blacks and 13,916 enslaved African Americans, compared to 12,103
Whites.) Of course, fear of that Black majority engendered the kinds of
naked oppression you might expect from those dedicated to maintaining
White supremacy by any means necessary. Segregation was the rule in
every area of Charlottesville public life. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[R]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[oss Johnson, my
great-grandfather was well aware of social, vocational and economic
lines that could or could not be crossed. Even a casual review of what
my ancestors endured in Jim Crow Virginia serves to underline the hope
and possibility that buoyed them on their journey out of the South.
During the Civil War, Iowa had been on the Union side of things (thank
goodness!) and so this land was blessed with a somewhat more
progressive, humanistic perspective than, say, Missouri or the states
that had been in the Confederacy. So, Ross and Blanch Porter Johnson
left Charlottesville in 1893 for coal mining work on the Iowa prairie.
My grandmother, Lettie Porter Thompson, was born in Monroe County on
November 19, 1896.]{.CharOverride-26}

[A]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[s a child in Iowa, Lettie
experienced a totally different social matrix than the one she would've
endured in Charlottesville. That is not to say her family members didn't
experience reduced opportunities because of their skin color, but life
was materially better in Iowa if for no other reason than that they were
able to take advantage of social and educational opportunities denied
them in the South. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[hat my Grandmother could proudly
say of her Iowa childhood: "we didn't know nothin' 'bout no
segregation!" meant that something very significant had occurred. With a
gleam in her eye that was still there in her 80s, she told me, "The
happiest time was getting out for recess because you could play with ALL
the children on the playground." ]{.CharOverride-26}

[ ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[Over the years, my grandmother
described Buxton as generally a very good place to grow up. "I don't
like this one, I don't like that one...can't go here, can't go
there...we never had that nonsense!" That was Lettie...always keeping it
real. Perhaps the most important thing was that you could get along with
people, and basic respect was accorded to just about everyone---unless
you couldn't handle your liquor.]{.CharOverride-26}

[H]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[er biggest regret was leaving
high school before graduation. Working to help support the family was
necessary, though, and so while her two sisters, Katherine and Anzul,
were able to finish high school (Katherine was a state debate champion
in the late 30s), Lettie, also a fine musician, sacrificed her potential
opportunities for the sake of others in the family. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[he grace with which Lettie
Thompson lived her life was a model for folks both Black and White. As I
mentioned, she wouldn't allow talk about racial disharmony, and she
instilled high standards in her family in terms of education, personal
behavior and vocational excellence. . ]{.CharOverride-26}

[G]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[etting along with people of any
ethnicity was the hallmark of my grandmother's philosophy of life. She
lived it and wouldn't tolerate any derogatory talk about anyone. When I
was a youngster, my parents would go for drives, visiting friends both
Black and White in little communities outside of Des Moines. Mom and Dad
would pack my two brothers (Kevan and Don) and me into dad's beloved '55
Dodge and head off to Albia, Marshalltown, Perry or somewhere else where
the family had friends from the Buxton days. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[I]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap

2018, I was happy to find out that the Buxton Club still sustains the
memory of the place. It's amazing that over a century later, the
memories of Buxton still have a powerful impact on those whose
predecessors directly experienced it. Without question, these are the
cornerstones of My Integrated Life. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[M]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[y maternal family's experience
in Buxton was key to establishing sympathetic, forthright relationships
with people regardless of ethnic or racial difference. My parents'

here.]{.CharOverride-26}

got married in early 1949. A few months before I was due to be born, Mom
decided that she wanted to be near her family. Ellsworth and Mary left
L.A. and moved back to Iowa---just in time for me to arrive in October
of 1949 at Mercy Hospital. ]{.CharOverride-26}

Redd]{.CharOverride-26}[6]{.CharOverride-55}[---originally from
Hannibal, Missouri---while certainly not the only good piano player, was
the most respected African American jazz piano player of the 50s and 60s
in Des Moines. Because he lived three blocks down Walker Street from us,
there were frequent music sessions involving him and my father. Charlie
Parker]{.CharOverride-26}[7]{.CharOverride-55}[ was the reigning king of
Jazz at that time, and I remember spirited discussions between the
musicians about how to interpret Bird's musical innovations. Speck was
posthumously inducted into the Des Moines Community Jazz Center (CJC)
Jazz Hall of Fame]{.CharOverride-26}[8 ]{.CharOverride-55}[in 2005. My

introduced during the 1940s by innovators like Charlie Parker); Mom
loved Rhumba, Merengue, and European Classical music of all kinds. I was
immersed in these sounds, almost inundated with them, from the time I
was born. I would sing (Mom would call it yowling) along with
records---no matter what style. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[hough my parents later divorced
and for a time my father drifted out of my life, this was a time when I
gained my basic appreciation for ALL music dedicated to telling stories
and bringing healing to our beleaguered souls.]{.CharOverride-26}

[My early exposure to technology]{.CharOverride-54}

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[he Merriam-Webster dictionary
defines the word integration as "incorporating or coordinating separate
elements as equals into a social environment." It also has a
significant, though different, meaning in the world of mathematics.
]{.CharOverride-26}

[M]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[y father was familiar with both
the social and the mathematical contexts for integration. Ellsworth had
been one of the few Black radio officers in the Merchant Marine during
WWII. Dad integrated his aptitude for mathematics into his love of
music, and this led him to the Schillinger System of Musical
Composition]{.CharOverride-26}[10]{.CharOverride-55}[. Years later, at
my father's induction into the Iowa Jazz Hall of Fame, I learned from
his friends in attendance that he brought musicians to our Walker Street
house to teach them the Schillinger System. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[M]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[usic, mathematics and technology
were completely integrated in my father's mind. In my 20s, when I
encountered the writings of R. Buckminster
Fuller]{.CharOverride-26}[11]{.CharOverride-55}[, I found someone who
could clearly articulate complicated ideas in the same way my father
could. Bucky's ]{.CharOverride-26}[Operating Manual for Spaceship
Earth]{.CharOverride-52}[12]{.CharOverride-55}[ was an inspiration, and
it remains an inspiration to this day.]{.CharOverride-26}

[D]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ad also collected radios, and
the pieces in his collection were objects of fascination for me. I
remember a small room in our house that was filled with scopes and
electronic parts. As a youngster watching television (we baby boomers
were the first TV generation) I was awed by science fiction serials of
the day (Captain Video]{.CharOverride-26}[13

things called "tubes" inside, and to me they looked like little
spaceships. I delighted in removing them from the back of old radios and
zooming them around the room flying my mission to Mars.

[The 60s: Music, and ]{.CharOverride-54}[The Register]{.CharOverride-57}

[A]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ccording to my grandmother and
everyone else I knew, if there was something I wanted to do, I had to
get out there, prepare myself and go for it. During the tumultuous years
of the 1960s, I would find myself pursuing ambitions in two realms: the
literary and the musical. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[A]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[s a child in 1954-56, I had
watched Superman on television, but rather than Superman, I wanted to be
Clark Kent, the mild-mannered reporter. At age 12, I decided I wanted to
be a writer. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[I]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[n a similar way, my childhood
experience growing up in a hub of the musical community primed me also
for a passionate, lifelong obsession with music. It seems fitting that a
decade so filled with foment and change for our country should also be
transformational for me personally. It is yet another example of
integration as my life's theme. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[I]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[n 1964, my best friend George T.
Clinton (whom we called "G.T.") played the Hammond B3 organ in a band
called The Upsetters. It included drummer Jimmy Brown, guitarist Bernie
Fogel and bassist Wally Ackerson. I blame these guys for destroying what
was left of my resistance to making music a participation sport. George
lived in what was called the "Southeast Bottoms" or Chesterfield
district of Des Moines. Raised in the Shiloh Baptist Church, G.T. was
steeped in Gospel and Praise music, but he also studied jazz extensively
with our neighbor Speck Redd while he was still in middle school. By
1964, he had added the "gospel" of Little Richard to his repertoire, and
became Des Moines' first Beatles-era "rock star". His musical talent was
matched by a dangerously sexy rock star attitude that Jagger himself
might have envied. An African-American with a Beatle haircut (!) and an
instinct for knowing where the music of our generation was heading,
George introduced me to memorable jazz and rock music experiences long
before I considered actually performing myself. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[H]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[e introduced me to a local Jazz
Festival at the First Unitarian Church and took me to the KRNT Theater
to see Illinois Speed Press]{.CharOverride-26}[14
]{.CharOverride-55}[and Chicago Transit Authority (later
Chicago]{.CharOverride-26}[15]{.CharOverride-55}[), as well as Veterans
Auditorium to hear Cream]{.CharOverride-26}[16 ]{.CharOverride-55}[(god,
Eric Clapton played LOUD!!). He started taking me to his bands'
rehearsals and asked the bassist to show me how to play a blues bass
line. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[A]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[fter a lot of practicing in the
basement, I was playing bass myself, and in the winter of 1968 I went
with a group of friends to the Drake Fieldhouse for a concert by a band
from Chicago. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[I]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[t was the Paul Butterfield Blues
Band]{.CharOverride-26}[17 ]{.CharOverride-55}[featuring the legendary
harmonica player and singer. He introduced 17-year-old Buzz Feiten on
guitar to us. Also on board were Phillip Wilson on drums, Tenor
saxophone player/vocalist and songwriter Brother Gene Dinwiddie, and I
think David Sanborn was in there, too, on alto saxophone.
]{.CharOverride-26}

[ ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[I had never heard of this band
before, but after the concert I went out and bought their new album
("The Resurrection of Pigboy
Crabshaw]{.CharOverride-26}[18]{.CharOverride-55}[") and lost the rest
of my mind while playing it. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[E]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[verything about this music
confirmed that something big was missing from my own life. My mother and
father had divorced sometime in the 1961 through 1963 period. I'm not
sure when, exactly, because between the ages of 11-13, memories of my
father seemed to just gradually fade away. My brothers and I were used
to him going to out of town engagements, but as I got into middle school
I realized that he was just...gone. I must've eventually been told the
who/what/why/when and how of the situation but that didn't soften the
emotional upset. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[he songs, the lyrics, the
sound...everything about the music I began listening to after the Paul
Butterfield concert seemed to beckon me back home. There was something
so inherently comforting and challenging at the same time that something
inside of me literally cracked open, I suppose. What was revealed was a
yawning cavern of stuffed pain, questioning and longing to understand
what, besides my dad, happened to be missing from my life.
]{.CharOverride-26}

[I]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap
.CharOverride-26}[struggled to deal with feelings that had nothing to do
with striving, with achieving, or with caring about social position. I
discovered the primal longing that each of us is subject to as human
beings. It was the simple realization that my family had fractured and I
had tried to act as if nothing was wrong in the years since the divorce.
My brothers and I were trained to keep moving forward and not to talk,
think about, or acknowledge the chaos that enveloped our lives in the
years 1960-70.]{.CharOverride-26}

[A]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[fter the Butterfield Concert,
with friends Rick Arbuckle, Paul Micich, Frank Tribble, and Sylvester
Strother, I started the Black and Blues Band as a kind of serious hobby.
I was really glad I learned to play the blues on bass and guitar,
because I was ready to fit right in to the Blues Revival that followed
in the wake of the British
Invasion]{.CharOverride-26}[19]{.CharOverride-55}[. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[I]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap
.CharOverride-26}[feel it important here to mention that Blues
music---that quintessential African-American music form native to the
USA---was being ignored by almost everyone in 1960. By 1964, though, the
Beatles, the Rolling Stones, The Kinks, Fleetwood Mac and other British
rock stars revealed that the secret of their success was the Blues
elements they cribbed from Americans like B.B. King, Muddy Waters,
Elmore James, Little Richard, Sonny Boy Williamson, Gatemouth Brown and,
of course, Mr. Crossroads himself, Robert Johnson. It was deeply ironic:
White kids all over America were losing their minds over British
musicians who credited, praised and emulated the Black originators of
the music. I believe the homage musicians like Mick Jagger, Paul
McCartney and others paid to their Black mentors added momentum to an
American Civil Rights movement that sought to restore humanity and
dignity (and commercial success) to many of those same individuals.

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[he summer before my senior year,
I scored my first job, sweeping up the floors at Kassar Drug Store on
Locust Avenue. It was, as advertised, a pretty menial gig, and while I
was sweeping there was lots of time to think about what I really wanted
to do with my life. I was already taking journalism classes at North
High School with Mr. Barnett, and I was already Sports Editor for the
]{.CharOverride-26}[North High Oracle]{.CharOverride-52}[. Importantly,
I had also written some articles for the ]{.CharOverride-26}[Iowa
Bystander]{.CharOverride-52}[20]{.CharOverride-55}[, the state's most
established newspaper for the African American community.
]{.CharOverride-26}[Bystander]{.CharOverride-52}[ editor Allen Ashby was
my first mentor. He was a wise, knowledgeable man who prepared me well
to go forward. So during the late summer 1967, as I was slinging the
broom at Kassar's, I thought that my experience might enable me to at
least try to get a job at the ]{.CharOverride-26}[Des Moines
Register.]{.CharOverride-52}[ I just remember thinking: "This is it. Go
and at least ask about a job."]{.CharOverride-26}

[I]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap
.CharOverride-26}[put the broom aside, checked out, and walked the four
blocks to the ]{.CharOverride-26}[Register & Tribune]{.CharOverride-52}[
building. Once inside, I asked the receptionist where to apply for a job
and she told me Fourth floor (while looking at me like she was thinking:
"Sure kid, go on up...fat chance though...") ]{.CharOverride-26}

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[hanking her, I turned and walked
through the lobby toward the elevators, noticing the huge, slowly
rotating globe that displayed the time in every country. I also looked
up to see the big, mounted panels displaying Pulitzer Prize winning
stories, editorial cartoons and headlines. At that point in history, the
]{.CharOverride-26}[Register and Tribune ]{.CharOverride-52}[newspapers
WERE the news sources all Iowa (and most of the Midwest) depended upon.
]{.CharOverride-26}

[I]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap
.CharOverride-26}[got off the elevator, turned left twice and walked
into a beehive convention in which activity was going off in all
directions at once. I had happened to arrive just at Saturday
afternoon's sports deadline, where---it seemed---every living being who
wasn't playing football somewhere in Iowa was covering someone playing
football somewhere in Iowa. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[S]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ports Editor Leighton Housh was
patrolling the writers' desks where Bill Bryson

coffee in the morning edition. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[W]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[hen a break came in the action,

this job, and what made me think I could.]{.CharOverride-26}

in, thinking: ]{.CharOverride-26}[Wait...he said...come back

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[hat moment validated everything
I had ever been told by my family about the way opportunity would be
open to you if you were prepared. The civil rights era was right on top
of us then, and this gave me a certain amount of courage, I suppose, to
go after what I really wanted. As I see it, moments like this
one---where courage is what's required, if we are going to step up and
seize the opportunity when we have the chance---come to all of us sooner
or later. Ethnicity has very little to do with it. Mine was a quiet
triumph. In seeking an objective that I felt prepared to handle, I was
confirming both parental guidance and personal observation of the way
things could be. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[I]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ntegration is a part of this
time in my life: when I was hired as a coffee boy, sports phone desk
person and copy runner, I was the only African American on the
]{.CharOverride-26}[Register]{.CharOverride-52}[ editorial staff.
]{.CharOverride-26}

[S]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[oon after I was hired, though,
other African Americans followed: photographers Ron Bayles and (fellow
North High graduate and NHS Hall of Fame Inductee) David Lewis came
onboard, as well as the (great) feature writer (and another North High
graduate) Elenora E. Tate. Each brought extremely high levels of
professionalism to the job. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[A]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[nother important milestone that
I should note: after serving for a few months as coffee boy and copy
runner, I was reporting on high school sports events and learning the
ropes of general assignment reporting. On April 4th 1968, I was on the
spot for the reporting break of a lifetime---which sadly, was connected
to the death of a great American hero. Martin Luther King's
assassination was an earthshaking event, and in the wake of his murder
Black communities across the nation erupted in rioting and what amounted
to a communal scream of pain, anger and sorrow. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[D]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[es Moines' Black community also
ignited in violence that consumed the central corridor along University
Avenue. I was in the sports department when I was approached by the city
editor with a question: Would I be able to grab a camera and go to the
area of the rioting to take pictures and report on what might be
happening? ]{.CharOverride-26}

[B]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[efore I knew it, I was stepping
over fire hoses in the street, avoiding the police who were trying to
keep order, and estimating the size of the groups of people who were
either part of the action or observers. Martin's death was a tragedy
that I felt viscerally, but I was being given a chance to contribute to
the reporting of a major news story. In later years, I learned that
event was a sad but important launching pad for more than a few other
Black journalists of that era, including the late Ed Bradley. After that
night, I was moved to general assignment reporting covering stories
including the Iowa legislature. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[hankfully, my faith in my
ability to attain a job that I wanted was greater than my fear of being
rejected. Racist messages, seeking to sow fear and doubt about people of
color, were as strong then as they are now. Knowing about my family's
experiences in Iowa over the last 100-plus years, though, helped provide
me with the perspective I would need to navigate a new world for which
there were few road maps. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[L]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ooking back on it, I think the
best thing about my time at the ]{.CharOverride-26}[Des Moines
Register]{.CharOverride-52}[ was acquiring great research skills. The
esteemed Iowa author Bill
Bryson]{.CharOverride-26}[23]{.CharOverride-55}[ and I both began
working for the ]{.CharOverride-26}[Des Moines Register
]{.CharOverride-52}[while still in high school. His father, Bill Bryson
Sr. was one of the nation's great sports writers. Bill Jr. and I were
high school-age copy runners and cub reporters learning the ropes, but
we began a friendship that continues to this day. Those who love Bill's
body of work appreciate granular research combined with the wit of a
happy sage. Bill began developing those gorgeous research skills whilst
searching out obscure bits of information in the

files in 1967-68. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[he investigative reporter is the
original Google. They never rest, and they never stop turning over rocks
to find the truth. Learning where to look, whom to ask, and whom to
"socially engineer" have always been the hallmarks of those who went out
and got the story, and got it right. Pulitzer-Prize-winning writers like
Nathan 'Nick' Kotz]{.CharOverride-26}[24]{.CharOverride-55}[ and the
]{.CharOverride-26}[Register's]{.CharOverride-52}[ own Clark

worlds became a little too well integrated. Let me
explain:]{.CharOverride-26}

[D]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[uring my sophomore year at

was doing pretty well. I was getting lots of opportunities, and like a
hungry kid at a banquet I was grabbing everything I could.

[I]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap

waiting for something to happen. Meanwhile, the little AM radio on the

a very close contest. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[Man, how did this

difficult for me to ignore internal questions about my absent father.

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[he tragedy of the Kent State

[t]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[hat I didn't care, or that it
didn't matter wasn't working for me anymore. In the spring of 1969, I
was sitting in my office at Drake when I had a revelation-like flash:
I'm a reporter. I can find out everything else; why don't I find my
father? Wow! good question Dartanyan. What would a good reporter
do?]{.CharOverride-26}

[I]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap
.CharOverride-26}[decided a good reporter would try the musicians'
union. I got the number for the New York Musicians Union Local 212,
placed the call and asked: "Hello? Can you give me contact information
for Ellsworth Brown please?"]{.CharOverride-26}

["]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[Just a minute...yeah we've got a
number right here for you."]{.CharOverride-26}

[H]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[oly crap. I had my Dad's phone
number. Now the question was: "Do I reeeallly want to make the call?"
]{.CharOverride-26}

[N]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[o longer able to quell the inner
chaos that draped over me like a heavy overcoat, I dialed the number in
hopes that some resolution might be gained from closing this long
unresolved circle. Hearing his "hello" on the other end of the line, I
felt like a salmon arriving back upstream to its spawning grounds. My
father's voice resolved the suspended chords of my life. I think we were
both relieved that we were still alive and that positive energy seemed
to attend our reunion. We filled each other in on some key points. Yes,
Ellsworth was still a working musician, living on Staten Island. No,
Dartanyan didn't play a lot because he was in college, and working as a
journalist. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[hat call was the coolest thing
ever, and after it I updated my brothers Don and Kevan on the news.
Reconnecting with dad was literally life changing, as all three of us
would try, with varying degrees of success, to rebuild a relationship
with Ellsworth and to make up for the time lost. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[A]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[fter the call, I resolved to go
to NYC to see dad during my Spring break. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[O]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ur reunion was pretty crazy. We
obviously had love for each other, but it was also obvious that,
generationally speaking, we had developed very different views of the
world. Example: I played electric bass and Dad thought all electric
instruments were illegitimate. It was a great first meeting, though, and
when it was time for me to return to Des Moines, I found out that, in
addition to his music, Dad had high respect for German engineering. He
was an excellent Volkswagen and Mercedes repairman, and gifted me with a
Volkswagen bus from his small collection of vehicles.]{.CharOverride-26}

[U]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[pon my return to Des Moines, I
knew that my life trajectory was changing. Youthful frustration with the
hypocrisy of the Viet Nam war was palpable. We intuitively knew that the
government's intentions were not what they were said to be. Our
generation had to be both courageous and outrageous enough to look
beyond the stories we were being told and to find out for ourselves how
to enact our morals. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[rying to keep all of this
balanced in my 19-year-old brain was causing burn out. My grades were
going down, and staying up until 2 a.m. jamming with my musician friends
wasn't really helping me in classes. Something was going to give; I just
wasn't prepared for how it would happen. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[I]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap
.CharOverride-26}[was spending more time playing with musicians in town
and discovering where jazz, blues, rock, and even country players were
jamming and experimenting. There were always adoring fans at these
happenings. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[D]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[es Moines might have been
Hicksville in some ways, but marijuana still found its way there just
like everywhere else in the 60s. In fact, it was hard NOT to run into
the plant during those days. I mentioned my tee-totaling folks earlier
in this story and, of course, they had the same attitude about pot.
While I wasn't partaking (yet) it was always being offered\...and I
usually declined.]{.CharOverride-26}

[W]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ell...
and....]{.CharOverride-26}

[O]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ne time a gal offered me a
half-smoked joint and I didn't want to be impolite, so I took her
half-smoked gift and stuck it in my billfold saying, "If it's ok with
you, I'll save it for later." Famous last words.]{.CharOverride-26}

[Busted]{.CharOverride-54}

[L]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ater that evening, I was driving
my newly acquired VW bus near campus when, all of a sudden, the jarring
lights of a police car in my rearview mirror brought me to attention. In
the best of times, Black guys don't want to see flashing police lights
in your review mirror. Upon request, I offered up my ID and waited for
everything to be ok. I hadn't gotten my permanent license plates for the
bus yet...but I had the paper temporary permit, which was taped, to the
rear window. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[W]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ell, he looked at my driver's
license, looked at me, looked at my license again...and then told me
that I was under arrest!!?! He kind of grinned as he held up my driver's
license so I could see....something..stuck..on..my..license?!
]{.CharOverride-26}

[J]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[eez, I mean, how often do you
hand a policeman your driver's license...with a marijuana roach stuck to
it? While he held it out in front of me, I took a last desperate
opportunity to 'save myself.' I grabbed the roach and stuck it in my
mouth and swallowed it. He didn't seem to know whether to laugh or hit
me, but in that moment, my life passed before me and I knew it wasn't
going to be ok for a while. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[wenty years of building,
working, preparing, praying and striving were (as I thought at the time)
about to be completely wiped away. A roach no bigger than my fingernail
blew up my life as completely as if I had set off a bomb. Which, in fact
I had. Taken to jail, I had to call my mother to bail me out, and you
can believe I'll never forget the look on her face. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[O]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[f course, I went from covering
the news to ]{.CharOverride-26}[being]{.CharOverride-52}[ the news in
the worst way possible. The sense of shame was searing. The hopes and
aspirations of many in my family and community were upended with my
arrest for what amounted to the politically motivated machinations of
Richard Nixon. Fifty years later, when in many cases we refer to
marijuana as medicine, it seems a tragedy that he had the power to alter
so many lives for a craven political motive. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[o say I was forever scarred by
the experience was understatement. The real, deeper lessons of the
experience took some time for me to tease out of the chaos. At this
lowest point in my life thus far, I was ready to chuck it all. As I was
sinking, though, I was thrown a lifeline. It was called
Wheatstraw....]{.CharOverride-26}

[I]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[n April 1970, musicians Ron
Dewitte, Craig Horner and David Bernstein asked me to join their band,
and since the band's former bass player (whom I replaced) owned its
former name, "The American Legend," we'd have to find a new name. We
were blues addicts at this time, and there was an obscure guy named
Petey Wheatstraw. We thought that name (also on cigarette papers of that
time) was funny, so we went with it for a band name. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[F]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[unny what joining a \$90-a-week
Blues band and leaving town will do for your crushed ego. I learned to
care again. I started to care about myself and slowly dare to rebuild a
value system. My searing sense of failure began to ease as I devoted
many hours to practice, listening, analyzing and performing with my new
band mates. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[I]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[t was also a good thing that I
was now actually communicating with my father. With his help, I
eventually came to see that leaving college was a personal reset that
put my life on a more sentient path. It sure beat going to Viet Nam to
kill (or be killed) by folks I didn't even know. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[Last Resort?]{.CharOverride-54}

[I]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap
.CharOverride-26}[might not have considered leaving everything behind to
join a blues band if it hadn't been for guitarist Ron Dewitte, who was
eventually inducted into the Iowa Blues Hall of Fame with me in 2010. He
was one of the most expressive blues guitar players I had ever heard.
The touch, timing and fire that distinguished his playing rivaled
anything I'd ever heard from anyone short of Jimi Hendrix. Craig Horner,
our keyboardist and trumpet player, was also a fine musician who spent
long hours practicing and listening to everyone from John
Coltrane]{.CharOverride-26}[29]{.CharOverride-55}[ to Jimi Hendrix.
Importantly, I discovered that culture isn't just about famous
individuals. It's what my friend, University of Indiana music professor
David Baker, described as the Inner Circles vs. the Outer Circles. The
marketplace needs "stars" (outer circles) for sure, but the real
"capillaries of culture" (inner circles) are those local masters of
community knowledge and custom who often remain unknown beyond their
locality. So, while you may not have heard of Ron Dewitte, Craig Horner
or David Bernstein, there was no doubt these guys dedicated their lives
to expressing musical truth. Wheatstraw spent a fair amount of time on
the road during 1970-72, playing the Midwestern states of Iowa,
Wisconsin, Illinois and Minnesota.]{.CharOverride-26}

[I]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[t was in Wisconsin that a new
chapter was getting ready to begin for me, but I sure didn't recognize
it at the time.]{.CharOverride-26}

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[he first time I heard Bill
Chase]{.CharOverride-26}[30]{.CharOverride-55}[ was when Wheatstraw was
booked at Judy's Gin Mill (!), a beer bar in Fond du Lac Wisconsin. It
was a Friday afternoon and David, Ronnie and I were sitting around our
hotel room doing basically nothing. Things were calm until Craig
literally burst through the door (knocking over a nightstand in the
process) and leaped to the record player. He took the record that was
playing on the turntable and frisbee'd it across the room. Replacing it
with one he held, he said: "You guys are NOT going to believe this\...!"
]{.CharOverride-26}

[A]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[nd with that, we heard the first
track of Chase's first album entitled "Open Up
Wide\...."]{.CharOverride-26}

[O]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[nce I peeled my brain off the
ceiling, I researched Bill Chase and discovered he'd been a star trumpet
soloist for big bands of the 60s, including Maynard
Ferguson]{.CharOverride-26}[31]{.CharOverride-55}[, Woody
Herman]{.CharOverride-26}[32]{.CharOverride-55}[ and Stan
Kenton]{.CharOverride-26}[33]{.CharOverride-55}[. Bill was a monster
trumpet player and now he was a band leader whose first single ("Get It
On") would become an international hit song. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[H]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[earing the album definitely
changed my impressions of what music could be; but at the time, I had no
idea that Chase's music would literally reshape my life about 24 months
from that moment. Wheatstraw toured for two more years, surviving until
1972, when in desperation we became Six the Hard Way (don't ask\...).
Reality finally caught up to us, though, and I went back to Des Moines
to write music and finish a journalism degree. Or so I
thought...]{.CharOverride-26}

[W]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[hen I returned to Des Moines
after the Wheatstraw experience, I formed my first working group, called
Dynamite. It was an extremely funky quartet featuring members Phil
Aaberg on piano, Rod Chaffee on guitar, Tom Gordon on drums, and yours
truly on bass guitar. A band of writers, we played bluesy-jazzy roots
music that morphed from one style to another with great relish. Our
influences were as wide ranging as John Coltrane, Paul Butterfield, John
Cage]{.CharOverride-26}[34]{.CharOverride-55}[, the group Tree (an Iowa
City Free Jazz collective), Donny
Hathaway]{.CharOverride-26}[35]{.CharOverride-55}[ and the Sons of
Champlin]{.CharOverride-26}[36]{.CharOverride-55}[. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[D]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ynamite was a fun band with
talent to burn, but unfortunately for us (though fortunately for my
future), through a connection to the Kansas band The Fabulous
Flippers]{.CharOverride-26}[37]{.CharOverride-55}[, our drummer, Tommy
Gordon was called up to the "big time" to play with...Bill Chase!!
(Chase's second album, "Ennea," had been released a few months earlier).
Tommy was a great drummer who rightly jumped at the chance to play with
Bill. Of course, that meant the end of our great little Des Moines band
but things were far from boring\....]{.CharOverride-26}

[A]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[fter Tommy left town, I
collaborated with John Rowat, Bill Jacobs and Michael Schomers to start
a band called The Mothership. It was another more experimental band with
jazz/rock/country influences. We had a band house on the SE corner of
Des Moines on Army Post Road. Next door to our house there was a big
roadhouse called the 505 Club (which everyone called "The Five." It was
notorious as what I would call a "cowboy punch out" bar. It was a rough
joint, but the music that got played in there was worth the risk of
injury or dismemberment.]{.CharOverride-26}

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[he Five was owned and managed by
Dick Kampus, a large and hearty man with a real lust for throwing a
party, The Five was the classic edge-of-town bar which even the local
police didn't mess with too much because it was that rough.
]{.CharOverride-26}

[O]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ver the years, we saw lots of
different groups there. Funky horn groups like the previously mentioned
Flippers, singer Marvin
Spencer]{.CharOverride-26}[38]{.CharOverride-55}[, and lots of groups
from Kansas, Florida, Louisiana and elsewhere. The list of bands that
toured the roadhouse circuit to carve out a career is long. I was at
home next door to the club when one day the phone
rang\....]{.CharOverride-26}

[I]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap
.CharOverride-26}[picked it up. " Hello," I said.]{.CharOverride-26}

["]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[Hey Dart," said the excited
voice on the other end, "Get your ass over here now and hear this\...!"
I recognized the voice as Dick's from across the driveway at the Five.
]{.CharOverride-26}

["]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[What are you talking about,
man?" I queried. ]{.CharOverride-26}

["]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[Just get over here NOW, you
won't believe it." ]{.CharOverride-26}

[A]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[s I loped across the expanse of
white gravel, I heard the rhythmic thud of bass guitar and drums coming
through the walls of the club. As I got closer to the door, the
syncopation was getting "too good" if you know what I mean. By the time
I entered the cavernous club, it only took another two or three minutes
to realize that something special was happening on the stage---and this
was just rehearsal.]{.CharOverride-26}

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[he group rehearsing for the
evening's show was Wayne Cochran and his band, the CC
Riders]{.CharOverride-26}[39]{.CharOverride-55}[. For those of you
unfamiliar with the tradition, Wayne Cochran was a White soul singer in
the tradition of James Brown. The cool thing about Cochran was that he,
like Brown, was the real deal. He was a loud, signifyin', funkified
White boy who could drive an audience as well as any R&B veteran I ever
saw. But I digress\....]{.CharOverride-26}

[C]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ochran's energy emanated as much
from his band as from his own nasty soul. The band's engine was being
stoked by a tall skinny kid on bass who they called Jaco.
]{.CharOverride-26}

["]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[Jaco" was Jaco
Pastorius]{.CharOverride-26}[40]{.CharOverride-55}[, later bass player
for Weather Report]{.CharOverride-26}[41]{.CharOverride-55}[,
which---alongside Miles
Davis's]{.CharOverride-26}[42]{.CharOverride-55}[ electric bands, the
Mahavishnu Orchestra]{.CharOverride-26}[43]{.CharOverride-55}[, Return
to Forever]{.CharOverride-26}[44]{.CharOverride-55}[, and
Headhunters]{.CharOverride-26}[45]{.CharOverride-55}[---was one of the
most important jazz fusion bands of the 70s and 80s. When I saw him at
the Five, though, Jaco was the heart of Wayne Cochran and the CC Riders'
rhythm section, which also included guitarist Charlie Brent. (As a side
note, Brent---a dynamite arranger---would later contribute charts to
Bill Chase's second album, "Ennea.") ]{.CharOverride-26}

[W]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ell, I listened transfixed as I
watched Jaco creating totally loose, but on-the-mark bass grooves. His
sensibilities for groove and support and melodic bass playing were
strangely scary, but at the same time an affirmation of where I knew the
instrument could go. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[A]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[fter the rehearsal, I made a
beeline for the stage and introduced myself to Jaco. Being an old
newspaper reporter, I wasn't going to miss an opportunity to "interview"
this guy to find out where he got his bouncy, funky
style.]{.CharOverride-26}

[I]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap
.CharOverride-26}[offered our house next door if he wanted to hang out
with us, and for the next 3 days I played host to the Future Of Jazz
Electric Bass! We jammed, talked, went to the Cochran gig, then jammed
some more, talked a lot more about life, our families, Miles, and why
each of us had a lot to offer. I have never met a more honest, caring,
sensitive and talented individual than Jaco Pastorius in
1972.]{.CharOverride-26}

[W]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[hile Jaco was a natural musician
whose father played drums, he'd also studied with Ira
Sullivan]{.CharOverride-26}[46]{.CharOverride-55}[ at the University of
Miami]{.CharOverride-26}[47]{.CharOverride-55}[. His mom Greta was
someone he was totally devoted to. Jaco already had a young family then,
and it was his single-minded goal to support his family by convincing
everyone that he was the world's greatest bass player!
]{.CharOverride-26}

[H]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[e was convinced of that fact (I
certainly wasn't going to disagree, based on what I had heard) and he
told me of his plans to leave the Cochran band soon and travel to Boston
to join up with a new friend named Pat
Metheny]{.CharOverride-26}[48]{.CharOverride-55}[. Metheny, he said,
offered him an opportunity to teach at Berklee College of
Music]{.CharOverride-26}[49]{.CharOverride-55}[ in Boston. In 1976,
Metheny---who was then only 21---would make his seminal debut recording
"Bright Size Life"]{.CharOverride-26}[50]{.CharOverride-55}[ on ECM with
Jaco. Later in 1974, Pastorius and Metheny joined pianist Paul Bley and
drummer Bruce Ditmas to record an album on Bley's Improvising
Artists]{.CharOverride-26}[51]{.CharOverride-55}[
label).]{.CharOverride-26}

[A]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[nyway, the three days spent with
Jaco could only be termed as a meeting of kindred spirits. The next time
I saw him was 1976 at the Newport Jazz
Festival]{.CharOverride-26}[52]{.CharOverride-55}[. By then he was with
Weather Report and a true star. The best thing was, when I saw him
again, he actually spotted me at the back of a large auditorium (Alice
Tully Hall, I think) as I was walking in for Weather Report's sound
check. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[F]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[rom the stage, he saw me (barely
visible I was) and yelled at the top of his lungs "Hey DARTANYAN, HOW YA
DOIN'." It was a testament to his eyesight, his memory and his heart
that he actually remembered our time together after HIS life had changed
so radically.]{.CharOverride-26}

[O]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ne sad note: The Jaco I knew in
1972 was on a natural high of life. He neither smoked, nor drank, nor
even talked about anything but the most inspiring subjects. His goal was
to play with Miles Davis. Period. He knew he was good enough, musical
enough, and hip enough and that was that! ]{.CharOverride-26}

[I]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap
.CharOverride-26}[never saw Jaco again after Newport. Back in 1972, he
had told me that he had a chemical imbalance that meant his sensitive
system could not tolerate most drugs or any alcohol. Moving to NYC was
probably the worst thing he could have done because the influences on
him at that time were uniformly bad. Every time news came in about him
it was usually great professional triumph but leavened with the sad news
of his descent into drug and alcohol abuse. Still, I'll always have
memories (and the tapes) of the Jaco Pastorius I knew, who propelled
Wayne Cochran and the CC riders in '72. Bless you Jaco.
]{.CharOverride-26}

[Back to Bill\....]{.CharOverride-54}

[I]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[t was now spring '73 and, as I
mentioned earlier, Tommy Gordon, our drummer in Dynamite, had already
joined Chase through his Fabulous Flippers connection. Former members of
that group were touring with Bill touring in support of the "Ennea"
album, so Tommy's connection from years earlier had paid off. It was
about to do the same for me.]{.CharOverride-26}

[T]{._idGenDropcap-1}[he Sandhill crane's weary wing beats carry him
along with the flock, lower and lower, closer to the mud flats where the
flock will rest before continuing its migration. The setting sun glints
off shallow water, adding a rosy glow to the gray and brown of the
crane's outstretched wings. As the flock banks and descends, the air is
filled with the calls of ducks, geese, herons, egrets, and the many
shorebirds that are also visiting the marsh to rest and refuel. An
incredible forty-five percent of all North American shorebirds arrive at
this Kansas marsh, known as Cheyenne Bottoms
(]{.CharOverride-26}[h]{.CharOverride-1}[ttps://ksoutdoors.com/KDWPT-Info/Locations/Wildlife-Areas/Southwest/Cheyenne-Bottoms),
each year during their spring and fall migrations. Cheyenne Bottoms, the
largest inland marsh in the United States, is vitally important to the
survival of many shorebirds. It also brings 60,000 people to the area
each year, providing an opportunity for both children and adults to
learn about the importance of wetlands and the animals who live there.
]{.CharOverride-26}

[ ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[Although few would guess it,
Kansas contains one of the most crucial shorebird stopping places in the
western hemisphere. Each spring tiny western sandpipers, weighing only
0.8 to 1.2 ounces, leave their winter homes in the south to fly from 900
to 2,500 miles to reach their Alaskan breeding grounds. These diminutive
sandpipers must be able to find areas of marsh, swamp, or beach where
they can rest and store body fat to accomplish their marathon migration.
If the birds are unable to find enough food in one spot, they will be
forced to stop again. Too much delay will cause the birds to arrive late
to their summer breeding grounds. If too much of the short Arctic summer
has been wasted, some of the birds may choose not to mate. Since the
United States contains only three large shorebird stopping places east
of the Rockies, Cheyenne Bottoms is clearly indispensable.
]{.CharOverride-26}

[ ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[If you visit Cheyenne Bottoms in
late October or early November, in addition to seeing many ducks, geese,
and various shorebirds, you might be lucky enough to spot an endangered
whooping crane. In 1941 these tall white cranes numbered only sixteen.
Now there are nearly 300, partly thanks to safe havens like Cheyenne
Bottoms. Other protected or endangered species that visit the marsh are
the bald eagle, piping plover, and peregrine falcon. The wetlands have
been designated as a critical habitat for both whooping cranes and the
interior least tern. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[ ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[Before the arrival of Francisco
Coronado, only the native Indian tribes, such as the Cheyenne, after
whom Cheyenne Bottoms is named, knew of this place. Although other
explorers visited the region, and large numbers of settlers began
arriving in Kansas by 1854, it was not until the 1920s that anyone felt
moved to find out more about the thousands of birds that arrived at the
Bottoms each year. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[ ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[Frank W. Robl, a farmer from the
Ellinwood area, began banding birds at Cheyenne in 1924. He caught birds
with nets or traps that would not harm them. Once a bird was caught, he
secured a small metal band, containing his contact information, around
one of the bird's legs. He hoped someone, maybe a hunter, would recover
the bird and return the band to him, ]{.CharOverride-26}so he could
determine how far the banded birds had journeyed[. Robl found that the
birds he'd banded at Cheyenne Bottoms had flown to Kansas from all over
North America. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[R]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[obl
wa]{.CharOverride-1}[s]{.CharOverride-1}[ ]{.CharOverride-1}[astonished
at the returns he collected, receiving them from as far away as Alaska,
South Carolina, and California, while other birds were recovered in
Mexico and Honduras. Beside satisfying his own curiosity, Robl's work
served another purpose. He spoke at the State Wildlife Conference about
preserving Cheyenne Bottoms for migrating birds, and when he was offered
a few minutes on a national radio program in 1934, he told a million
people about the marsh. Others who were interested in creating a
wildlife refuge at Cheyenne joined with Robl to testify before the
Senate Committee on Wildlife, and he even contacted then-Vice President
Charles Curtis. In response to these efforts, Congress promised
\$350,000 for construction of dikes, roads, and hunting blinds for
sportsmen, so Cheyenne Bottoms could be properly managed. However,
because of the Depression, only \$50,000 were made available. Despite
this setback, Robl's dedicated banding of nearly 19,000 birds over a
quarter of a century showed the world how important Cheyenne Bottoms was
and helped protect the wetlands for many more generations of birds.
]{.CharOverride-26}

[ ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[In 1966, Edmund Martinez became
interested in banding the birds of Cheyenne Bottoms. Since Robl had
banded very few shorebirds, when Martinez began banding birds, only 349
shorebirds had been banded in all North America. Over the next twelve
years, Martinez banded over 58,000 birds from 32 species. His
northernmost return came from Siberia and his southernmost from
Argentina. A 1974 shorebird survey in which Martinez participated found
that no other place, from Texas to North Dakota, had even ten percent
the number of shorebirds that visited Cheyenne Bottoms. When the data
from the two men's research was combined, it became clear that the
wetlands was a vital oasis for migrating birds. ]{.CharOverride-26}

[I]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[n a ]{.CharOverride-26}[New York
Times]{.CharOverride-52}[ interview, Martinez said: "It's remarkable
what passes through Cheyenne Bottoms, sandpipers that winter in Tierra
del Fuego and breed in Siberia. I got to hold them in my hand and marvel
at how they do it. To get returns on birds that I banded from northern
Russia and South America, it really put into perspective what is going
on here in the center of Kansas. These small birds are the best athletes
in the world." (Laux).]{.CharOverride-26}

[ ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[Not only does Cheyenne Bottoms
provide shelter and food for many animals, it also draws many people to
Kansas, opens a door for people to learn about this very special wetland
ecosystem, and brings \$2.8 million into the state's economy annually.

[ ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[Cheyenne Bottoms is an essential
link in the yearly migration for tens of thousands of birds. Without the
dedicated work of Frank Robl and Edmund Martinez who showed the world
how significant this Kansas marsh is to the survival of many North
American shorebirds, this might not be the case. Robel and Martinez, who
invested their lives in studying, understanding, and protecting Cheyenne
Bottoms, have made it possible for us to visit the marsh, see the sun
sparkle on the shallow water, hear the raucous calling of geese, and
crane our necks to see flocks of thousands wheel in the sky. We can
marvel at their migration journey and should do what we can to ensure
that the waypoint they rely on will always be here to welcome them.

Good Cheer]{.CharOverride-2}

[S]{._idGenDropcap-1}[trong winds. Gray skies. A cold drizzle. Not an
optimal day to go for a prairie hike. But you hike when you have time to
hike, and weather be hanged. Today, Hinsdale Prairie
(h]{.CharOverride-1}[ttps://www.facebook.com/hinsdaleprairie]{.CharOverride-26}[)
steward Kath Thomas has promised me a tour of a prairie remnant, just
down the street from her house. Not much more than an acre, it's a tiny
remnant island adrift in a sea of development.]{.CharOverride-1}

[W]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[hat's a prairie remnant? Simply
put, it's a piece of the original tallgrass prairie that has not been
plowed or destroyed. Illinois once had 22 million acres of tallgrass
prairie; only about 2,300 high quality acres remain. Other Midwestern
states have even more dismal statistics. These remnants are often tucked
into old cemeteries, or the corners of farm fields. Along railroad
tracks. On rocky hilltops unsuitable for plowing. Or, places like this
alongside a freeway that escaped notice.]{.CharOverride-1}

[M]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[owers have knocked back the
prairie on the freeway side and it's been trimmed back along the
sidewalk which flanks it on the west. There's a roar of traffic from the
freeway. The din is overwhelming. A prairie---here? Really? If there is
birdsong, it's erased by the sounds of trucks. And yet...you feel it.
This is a special place.]{.CharOverride-1}

[A]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[s we hike, Kath points out the
bluebird houses. Anybody home? Nope, not today. Too late in the season.
As we brush aside the tallgrass and hike deeper into the prairie, the
real treasures emerge. Over here, spent prairie gentians. To the left,
prairie dropseed, lime-colored for autumn. Just ahead, the bloomed-out
spikes of Liatris, blazing star, with a few ballet-skirted seedheads of
Echinacea; pale purple coneflower.]{.CharOverride-1}

[O]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ther treasures appear as we
walk. Prairie dock. Some rough-cut leaves of compass plant. All of these
tell us we're walking through prairie, not an old field. Signs of a
survivor. The rain starts up again. Wind and wet blur the grasses into a
watercolor of motion.]{.CharOverride-1}

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[he rain also brings out the
globe-dark silhouettes of rattlesnake master and pops of black-eyed
Susan seedheads. I imagine these two plants in summer; their flashes of
silvery white and lemon yellow.]{.CharOverride-1}

[R]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[eality, in the form of more cold
drizzle, brings me back to the present. Kath will be the first to tell
you this little prairie remnant is here because of Dr. Robert Betz, who
identified prairie bush clover (]{.CharOverride-1}[Lespedeza
leptostachya]{.CharOverride-2}[) here in the 1970s and championed the
prairie's survival. We don't find the prairie bush clover as we hike
today, but we do find round-headed bush clover. Not nearly so unusual,
but still intriguing.]{.CharOverride-1}

[L]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ook around and discover a
jewelry box full of plant gems. New Jersey tea with its blown-out
seedheads and curl of last leaves. Bee balm, with its powdered leaves at
the end of the season, exhaling an astringent scent. Big bluestem, the
Illinois state grass, waves its turkey-footed seedhead against the gray
sky.]{.CharOverride-1}

[ ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[The Hinsdale Prairie refuses to
give up the ghost, despite inroads from utility work, encroachment by
development, and occasional mowing on the east and west side that shaves
off precious portions of the tallgrass. Crown vetch, teasel, and
daylilies threaten to dispossess the Indian grass, little bluestem, and
wild quinine.]{.CharOverride-1}

[K]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ath does everything she can to
raise awareness of this remnant. She founded "Friends of Hinsdale
Prairie," dedicated to advocating for the prairie on social media and
with local government. She intercedes for the prairie when she sees
unusual activity, like utility trucks parking on the grasses or
neighbors throwing yard waste into the wildflowers. She picks up trash.
Each day brings a new challenge. And Kath is only one
person.]{.CharOverride-1}

[B]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ut she's one person changing the
world, making a difference. Right where she lives. Kath inspires me that
change is possible---if only we will step up. Take care of the places
right in front of us. Tell others why something
matters.]{.CharOverride-1}

[H]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ow will you change your world?
There's never been a better time to find out.]{.CharOverride-1}

[F]{._idGenDropcap-1}[or the past decade my artwork and research has
focused on 'edgelands,' from a forest in Massachusetts bordering a
subdivision to a ragged prairie in Minnesota running along a railyard.
Edgelands act like scrims rendering other spaces invisible, yet the
edgelands are absent from most city maps. This wavering visibility seeps
into my photographs and drawings: the soft villous hairs on the
unfurling fern fronds are partially obscured by a puddle of green paint.
Edgelands are considered one of the last refuges of wildness. I
photograph and draw the plants I discover in these overgrown patches of
"weeds" as the seasons change. My images are as much about making
visible this overlooked landscape as they are about documenting the
passage of time.]{.CharOverride-1}

["]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[The Prairie Constructs" are an
ongoing series which catalogs the life and death of plants from the
edgelands of Minneapolis. Made almost entirely on the scanner bed, The
Prairie Constructs are a digital version of a photogram or botanical
solar print. The images are shown as both large-scale digital color
prints and as an artist book or compendium, showing the evolution in the
landscape over the course of a year. What started as a way of collecting
bits and pieces of plants as the seasons change has turned into a
methodical and sometimes frenetic project of gathering and experimenting
with each plant.]{.CharOverride-1}

[S]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ince I often uncover synthetic
materials, plastic bags mostly, as I collect plants I included these in
the images as well.]{.CharOverride-1}

[C]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[hance also plays an important
role because the view from below of the scanner is not visible until the
image appears on my screen. I place my materials within the frame and
then document them as they react and evolve (melt, flow, crumple, wilt),
often making multiple scans from a single combination of paint,
photographs, plants and plastics. I orchestrate this "organic process"
that is then recorded and amplified through digital
technology.]{.CharOverride-1}

[L]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ight is an important ingredient
in the transformation of my materials and in the elevation of these
spaces. I work with light when photographing the landscape, making the
scans and installing the images. In traditional landscape painting,
light can be interpreted as ]{.CharOverride-1}[lumen]{.CharOverride-2}[,
observed light, or ]{.CharOverride-1}[lux]{.CharOverride-2}[, divine
light or the light of reason. I prefer to think about light in terms of
Heidegger's description of
]{.CharOverride-1}[lichtung]{.CharOverride-2}[, which translates as
"light in a forest clearing." He argues that openness must precede
]{.CharOverride-1}[lumen]{.CharOverride-2}[ and
]{.CharOverride-1}[lux]{.CharOverride-2}[, observation and judgment. My
work enables me to be open to the natural world that is around me, even
in the city. It is this sense of wonder and awareness about the
persistence of urban nature that I want to pass on to viewers through my
images.]{.CharOverride-1}

[---]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[Thomas Merton,
]{.CharOverride-1}[Thoughts in Solitude]{.CharOverride-2}

[M]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-62}erton's powerful epigraph serves
as a compelling opening salvo, one that Robert Wolf himself sounds with
this creative and timely book, [Building the Agricultural City: A
Handbook for Rural Renewal
]{.CharOverride-30}[(]{.CharOverride-24}https://www.amazon.com/Building-Agricultural-City-Handbook-Renewal/dp/0974182648[)]{.CharOverride-24}[.]{.CharOverride-30}
Following in Merton's footsteps, Wolf provides us with an alternative
vision of rural America that, to many of us, may seem an impossible
fiction in light of what writer and critic Wendell Berry
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendell\_Berry) decried as the
"unsettling of America." This "unsettling" is a process, centuries in
the making, that has reverberated across our rural communities,
contributing to a sense of divisiveness between rural and urban locales.
It may cause most of us---especially those living in rural areas---to
believe that any alternative, positive future for rural America, like
the one Wolf envisions, simply defies reality.

[N]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[everthel]{.CharOverride-1}ess,
in this inspiring book, Wolf provides us with a practical scenario for
how we could actually experience a rural renewal grounded in the
evolution of a new paradigm. As Wolf points out, we now need to begin
building regional, alternative "arks" that envision alternative rural
futures in which rural and urban communities are no longer separated,
but become part of a [bioregion]{.CharOverride-30}, wherein rural and
urban citizens work together to produce new communities that are driven
by self-renewing regional capacities, in lieu of the current dominating
and centralized globalist economies. As Wolf says:

[R]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[egional]{.CharOverride-1}ism is
precisely the means by which we can reconstruct society with a human
face---if we have the collective will to do it. Regionalism is a form of
decentralization, and is at odds with our overly centralized system,
which seeks to impose uniformity in every sphere of activity (page 38).

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-63}[hose who think such a future is
unrealistic may want to also consult a new book by John Thackara,
]{.CharOverride-64}[How to Thrive in the Next Economy: Designing
Tomorrow's World Today
]{.CharOverride-52}[(]{.CharOverride-26}https://www.thamesandhudsonusa.com/books/how-to-thrive-in-the-next-economy-designing-tomorrows-world-today-hardcover[)]{.CharOverride-26}[,
in which he points out, based on his travels around the world, that such
rural/urban bio-regionalisms are, in fact, already happening in many
parts of the world.]{.CharOverride-64}

[O]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-63}[f course, communities across
the U.S. have been heavily influenced by the culture of the Green
Revolution, which envisioned, and created, a food system designed to
feed the world with cheap food produced by fewer farmers, thereby
producing an industrial, input-intensive food system designed for
"maximum, efficient, production, for short-term economic return." The
Green Revolution's proponents claim that bio-regional transformations
are untenable. Viewed from this perspective, the industrial
farming-and-food paradigm embodied in the Green Revolution seems
inevitable, and many believe that science and technology will insure its
resilience, and its economic efficiency ought to be enough to ensure its
attractiveness. Wolf views this paradigm as a limit on our imagination,
as it leads us to believe that the current order of things is simply the
way things will always be. As Wolf says:]{.CharOverride-64}

[C]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-63}[learly, achieving greater
self-sufficiency is not simply a technical problem. More than anything,
it is a social problem. Many people here \[in the Driftless Region of NW
Illinois, SW Wisconsin, and NE Iowa\], as elsewhere in America, believe
that our centralized system is a reality of nature, like the Atlantic
Ocean or the Adirondacks (page 31).]{.CharOverride-64}

[W]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[olf provides us with a different
scenario, pointing out some of the many reasons why the industrial food
system is already beginning to "approach collapse" and is likely to
include "chaos and violence" when it collapses. It is imperative, he
argues, that we explore an alternative food system and begin building
it.]{.CharOverride-26}

[O]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[f course, one]{.CharOverride-1}
of the many drivers of the Green Revolution model---as well as our
enthusiasm surrounding it---was our collective assumption that the
natural capital would always be there, throughout our industrial
economy---and that new technologies would constantly be developed to
replace it. Components of this natural capital would be healthy soil,
cheap minerals, plentiful fossil fuels, and abundant fresh water---all
essential to the "success" of our Green Revolution food system.

[N]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ow ]{.CharOverride-1}we are
beginning to recognize that many aspects of this natural capital are in
a state of depletion. As Wolf notes early in the book, "one of the
distinguishing features of contemporary American civilization is the
frequency of breakdowns and failures in industry, government, and
society itself. The size of the problem is enormous."

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ak]{.CharOverride-1}e, for
example, minerals. Rock phosphate---which is the "natural capital" from
which we manufacture our phosphorus inputs---is now depleted to a point
where we only have perhaps another ten year's-worth of supply remaining
on the planet. Or soil. Since we have paid little attention to restoring
the health of our soils in our input-intensive systems, we need large
quantities of fresh water for irrigation. This is due to the fact that
most of our soils now only absorb about a half an inch of rain water per
hour, so we now use approximately 70 percent of our freshwater resources
on the planet for agricultural irrigation. All of this, of course, is
beginning to increase costs and produce diminishing returns---especially
for farmers. In his recent book, [Growing a Revolution: Bringing Our
Soil Back to Life
]{.CharOverride-30}[(]{.CharOverride-24}https://books.wwnorton.com/books/detail.aspx?id=4294995584[),]{.CharOverride-24}
David Montgomery provides concrete evidence of how some farmers are
already beginning to alter their farming systems because the
input-intensive systems simply no longer produce positive economic
returns for them. Instead of continuing to rely on external inputs,
which are becoming more costly, they are beginning to employ practices
that restore the natural capital, reducing the need for the inputs.
These farmers are now reducing their costs, increasing their net
profits, and are no longer interested in "getting bigger."

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[hi]{.CharOverride-1}s begins to
make clear why the revolution Robert Wolf envisions is a practical
necessity. Even if we only consider cheap energy, minerals, soil and
water as part of the natural capital that has "sustained" our industrial
agriculture for the past century, we must recognize that they are all in
a state of depletion. As Wolf duly noted throughout his treatise, our
industrial economy will, at best, only survive for another two or three
decades:

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[h]{.CharOverride-1}e
centralization of American government, finance, and industry has grown
extreme, to the extent that it governs our life and work. Such a system
cannot long endure, and our various environmental and social breakdowns
are evidence of an ongoing crisis... Our institutions and corporations
have grown too large: everything exceeds human scale and has become
inhuman. It is imperative that we construct political and economic units
in which people can once again find a home (page 23).

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[his search for a
h]{.CharOverride-1}ome, for the reconstruction of our self-reliance, is
the compelling reason that Wolf's vision for the renewal of rural
America, beginning with arks of refuge from industrial capitalism in
places like the Driftless Region of the Upper Midwest, may seem strange
to those of us still locked into the culture of the industrial economy.
Wolf, looking back in our collective history, demonstrates how "early
American history is replete with examples of local and regional
self-reliance, from the Spanish Southwest to Yankee New England, from
Chesapeake Bay to the Carolinas and Georgia." Returning to that kind of
regional self-reliance can play a central role in deconstructing the
highly problematic political economy in which we live.

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[hose stil]{.CharOverride-1}l not
convinced may want to examine yet another recent publication by two of
our leading agroecologists, Peter Rosset and Miguel Altieri:
[Agroecology: Science and Politics]{.CharOverride-30}[
(]{.CharOverride-24}https://developmentbookshop.com/agroecology-science-and-politics[)]{.CharOverride-24}[.]{.CharOverride-30}
Rosset and Altieri highlight the key fact that the majority of food that
feeds the global population in today's world is being produced by
smallholder farmers farming five acres or less! Going further, Rosset
and Altieri point out that those smallholder farmers are already
employing, and have been for millennia, the very kind of agro-ecological
farming practices---grounded in "local autonomy, local markets and
community action"---that Wolf envisions for a future America. Finally,
it is also important to recognize that these "agro-ecological" farming
practices, which Rosset and Altieri describe, are operating as
"human-centered cultures" driven by community relationships, not by
machine-like alternative perimeter cultures that humans have to conform
to---exactly the kind of human-centered culture that Wolf envisions for
the Driftless region (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driftless\_Area) and
eventually America's future.

[F]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}inally, as we anticipate these
future changes, Wolf suggests we embrace not more
[technology]{.CharOverride-30}, but more
[imagination]{.CharOverride-30}. Therefore, the arts can play a critical
role in helping us to envision and adapt to this new future:

[R]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-2}[egionalism fosters a regional
culture.]{.CharOverride-30} Regionalism promotes the arts as a means of
maintaining regional consciousness. Regional consciousness in turn
fosters a willingness to work together, which in turn creates wealth
(page 39).

[F]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}rom my perspective, Wolf's book
is filled with important information---information that is vital for all
of us to digest as we anticipate the changes coming at us, so that we
can get an advanced start in preparing for them. Furthermore, by
beginning to construct a few "arks" here and there, it becomes possible
to demonstrate that the kind of human-centered, agro-ecological
community farming which is already "feeding much of the world" could
thrive in America. Doesn't that seem like a good way to start this
transformation?

the White-tailed Deer

[The white-tailed deer is widespread in the prairie region. It's natural
range stretches from Canada south through the continental U.S., Mexico,
and the countries of Central and South America, down to Peru and
Bolivia. The female]{.CharOverride-1}[---]{.Author-Name
.CharOverride-5}[the doe]{.CharOverride-1}[---]{.Author-Name
.CharOverride-5}[usually weighs under 100 lbs, but can range up to
nearly 200 lbs. The male]{.CharOverride-1}[---]{.Author-Name
.CharOverride-5}[the buck]{.CharOverride-1}[---]{.Author-Name
.CharOverride-5}[usually weighs around 100 lbs, though specimens
approaching 300 lbs have been known. Bucks are distinguished also by
antlers, which they shed and regrow yearly, and use to engage other
bucks in antler-to-antler pushing contests during the mating season,
usually late October to early November.]{.CharOverride-1}

[O]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}n the prairie, the introduction
of large-scale agriculture and the clearcutting of coniferous forests,
along with the virtual extirpation of the white-tail's natural
predators, has helped its population to explode.

[Vocalization]{.CharOverride-6}[: the white-tail has a repertoire of
social grunts and wheezes, but reserves its loudest sounds for the
mating season. During the rut, males will make a variety of grunts,
wheezing snorts and groans to announce their intentions, corral does, or
warn rivals.]{.CharOverride-1}

[Extraction, Roots, Energy, and the Plains]{.Letter-V_LeadPageTitles}

[by Sebastian Braun]{.Letter-V_Author-Name}

::: {#_idContainer454 ._idGenObjectStyleOverride-3}
[P]{._idGenDropcap-1}[eople in exile are experts on roots and energy.
They know how much energy is needed to extract roots, how much energy is
needed to stay uprooted, and, because a state of uprootedness is
unsustainable over the long run, how much to sink roots deep into the
ground again.]{.CharOverride-1}

[I ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[remember standing in North
Dakota and looking toward the horizon. One can actually see Earth as a
globe - the slight curve of the horizon, where the winds come from that
bend the grass and the few trees, and where the clouds gather that sweep
overhead, only to disappear again and make way for the blue sky.
Sometimes, looking toward the horizon, I would feel an overwhelming joy,
seeing mountains in the distance. It was usually a short emotion, as I
realized that my mind had played tricks. Those were not mountains, could
not be mountains. They were clouds that had swept me away toward home,
mirroring a more familiar landscape.]{.CharOverride-1}

[L]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[iving on the Great Plains costs
a lot of energy. The sky overhead is endless, and the people are exposed
to that sky as if on a plate. Shelter becomes more than a physical
necessity. Humility in the face of this force is self-imposing and
sometimes overpowering. There is a connection between people and nature,
because everybody is exposed to forces that cannot be tamed or
understood. At least, that is, until people started to surround
themselves with constant shelter, as if to avoid having to look into
that sky, to acknowledge the force, to be humble. Instead, they could
now disconnect themselves from nature, think of themselves as superior,
and think of distance in miles per hour, hurtling themselves quicker and
quicker through the landscape they no longer needed to acknowledge,
ripping up all their roots, at least the long, deep, strong roots that
hold the grasses in place against the winds. Instead, they now plowed
the earth and selected what roots were allowed to grow. And all of this
cost even more energy because to be without roots requires one to
levitate in place, nothing but a fleeting shadow over the land, which
has become but an abstraction, no longer real because it is just land.
There is no distinct smell of the earth, no change in winds that herald
rain, no experience of seasonality, no need to observe closely how its
other inhabitants behave, no sharing of the landscape with them. Kinship
and its obligations have been narrowed to the people in the shelter, and
has been turned against those outside the shelter. And so, with the
extraction of roots comes the need to extract more and more
energy.]{.CharOverride-1}

[E]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[nergy has become visualized for
me in the form of long trains of black tank cars and coal tenders moving
across the plains. When we lived in North Dakota, they were parked right
next to the campus of the university where I taught, and I often
wondered what would happen if the oil wagons exploded like they had done
in Lac Megantique
(]{.CharOverride-1}https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lac-M%C3%A9gantic\_rail\_disaster[)
and right outside Casselton. Now that I live in Iowa, the same wagons
rumble by our house about five times a week. Here, they are loaded with
ethanol, not oil or coal, but the image of energy being transported to
markets is the same. The Prairie-Plains are the heart that sends fuel to
the outliers. It is a restless procession of long trains, traveling
through places that try to still be rooted, yet are more and more
depopulated. People and grass have been uprooted and swept away, and
even those who have stayed behind need heavy machinery to anchor them
down, now that the roots are mostly gone and the shelterbelts are
disappearing. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[here are other ways that the
energy flows, of course. Pipelines cross the Plains like a vast network
of pulsating arteries. Not veins, however, as there is not much coming
back. Invisible, those lines are connected to the new artificial roots
of hydraulic fracturing. These roots fan out from wells, which draw
different nutrients out of the Earth, nutrients for the industrialized
society. However, just like the roots of water-hungry plants, these new
kinds of roots are also thirsty. They are thirsty for poisonous
nutrients---oil and gas---that they extract, but they also put poisons
into the Earth. Toxic materials are mixed into the water that is used
for fracturing the rocks, and fracturing wells are extremely thirsty. In
2016, a well in the Bakken oil field
(]{.CharOverride-1}https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakken\_Formation[)
required 5.5 million gallons of water, while one in the Permian basin
used 11.2 million gallons of water. In August of 2018, the Bakken had
12,571 producing oil wells. Some of this "water", too, will flow back
out. This is now called ]{.CharOverride-1}[produced
water]{.CharOverride-2}[, but it really has not much in common anymore
with water. It is about twenty times saltier than ocean water, slightly
radioactive, and highly toxic. Apart from its use in the artificial
roots of hydraulic fracturing, it can not be allowed to ever come into
contact with other roots. This brine needs to be disposed of, hopefully
for ever, and it is usually injected back into the Earth. In the United
States, about 180,000 Class II injection wells pump over 2 billion
gallons of fluids into the Earth every day, most of them in the southern
Plains. What happens when these fluids are not injected deep enough or
break free from their layers can be seen on the Fort Peck Indian
Reservation (]{.CharOverride-1}http://www.fortpecktribes.org[) in
Montana. Here, an underground brine plume has been migrating slowly
through water wells for the past 40 years, a legacy of injection
practices in the 1970s. Slowly spreading toward Poplar and the Missouri
River, the only solution for this catastrophe has been to try and pump
it to the surface again, and then to inject it deeper.
]{.CharOverride-1}

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[he pulse of this network has
become constant beneath the soil, and in some places, it has become so
strong that it regularly causes small earthquakes. Whether or not these
pulses will eventually set the liquids free is a matter of debate that
will only be shown by time. If, however, any of the produced waters make
their way to the grass roots, people, plants, and animals will have to
leave. Under the ground sleeps the greatest danger to communities. It
might be a telling sign that a break in a produced water pipeline is
much more impactful than a break in an oil pipeline. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[he Prairie-Plains have become
the roots for the United States, where wheat, oil, soybeans, corn, and
coal are extracted from the soil to feed the cities far away. Not much
thought is spent on the roots. They are often regarded as boring and
colorless and are taken for granted. Eighty years ago, during the Dust
Bowl
(]{.CharOverride-1}https://www.history.com/topics/great-depression/dust-bowl[),
the nation did come to realize that it had better pay attention to the
roots when the topsoil was flying away. One of the best kept secrets of
the Plains lies in Denbigh, North Dakota, an assembly of houses off the
main road to Minot. Across that road stands the Denbigh Experimental
Forest
(]{.CharOverride-1}https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/dpg/recarea/?recid=80604[).
At first, it might come as a surprise that the ground in the forest is
mostly sand. This sand is not the leftover of a prehistoric beach or
long-ago glacier, but the result of much more recent overgrazing and
over-plowing. In fact, the forest was planted as a grand plan to save
the soil. It was one part of the national response to the destruction of
the plains grass-, range-, and farmlands. The original plan called for
planting a series of 100 mile long shelterbelts, a mile apart, over more
than a thousand miles from North Dakota to Texas. While this plan was
eventually given up, between 1935 and 1942, the Forest Service planted
220 million trees in the Plains. Denbigh was to be one of the nurseries
for these trees. Standing in the midst of these trees in the middle of
nowhere, a tree island in a sea of industrialized agriculture, I found
it hard not to think of the imagined and real root systems holding the
soil and people in place and to compare it to the oil boom ongoing a
hundred miles further west. There are no Denbigh forests, no designed
areas of seeds to fan out and protect the land against this new kind of
industrialized havoc. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[T]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[he Denbigh trees were and still
are an illustration of the possibilities to make roots. Like plants,
animals and people can become rooted in a place. Humans do that by
establishing a relationship with a place: by listening to the landscape
and its inhabitants. The stories that we learn and share in this process
are our roots, they hold us to the places we engage with. It is hard to
say how long it takes to become rooted. A few generations is my guess.
Once we know the stories of all the places around, above, and below us,
we are rooted. By that time, we are also rooted in the ground because
our ancestors have related to the same places. Rooted knowing is not
knowledge formally learned, but sensually experienced. It is the
knowledge of how the dirt smells and feels and tastes after a rainstorm.
It is the ability to find one's way through the landscape of stories. It
is the skill to predict the weather by looking out the window and to
estimate distances by how long it takes to walk along the contours of
the land. And it is to understand that that we humans are just one of
the parts in any place that we live, to be humble before greater forces
with great and small powers. The energy of place is tied to roots, but
those are the roots of community, not extraction.]{.CharOverride-1}

[W]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[hen I was younger, I used to
mountain bike on the mountain behind the house where I lived in
Switzerland. There is a place there where the trees give way to a cliff,
and there I can experience my home. Looking out over the Sundgau, I can
see the Belchendreieck, the mythical triangle of mountains in the
Vosges, the Black Forest, and the Jura that served as an astronomical
calendar and a place power grid to the people before me. Looking west
and north, there are possibilities of openness, promises of adventure,
and winds of chance. I always longed to know what lay beyond the next
ridge. The Plains, although topographically the opposite of my home in
Switzerland, remind me of it, possibly because they offer an endless
opportunity to go farther, a constant draw toward the horizon. Perhaps
that is why I fell in love with the Plains the first time I traveled
them.]{.CharOverride-1}

[F]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ew things are better than lying
awake at night in a tent, smelling the sage, and watching the
thunderstorms on the horizon parade by. Some people tell me that there
is nothing on the Plains, that it is fly-over and drive-through country.
They have never taken the dirt tracks to watch pelicans on remote lakes,
have never gotten stuck in Plains gumbo, have never observed ground
squirrels playing around their tent. These days, I too hurry through the
Plains to get places, and sometimes I feel a pain for passing by all the
places that I know lie right over the hills, in beautiful valleys, away
from the interstates and the industrial fields. There is nothing as
depressing as a flattened, brown, industrialized, ploughed landscape
devoid of roots. There is nothing as beautiful as a wide river valley
with a sprinkling of savannah trees. To allow and make people see this
beauty, we need to open the land to the public, to allow people onto the
land, not in small, enclosed parcels, but in continuous flows, traveled
in days, experienced close at hand. Observed, listened to, smelled, and
tasted. ]{.CharOverride-1}

[I]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ronically---or perhaps not at
all---those landscapes would also provide us with material energy. The
energy returned over energy invested ratio for all those wagons full of
corn ethanol that roll behind my house is lousy and unsustainable.
Instead of plowing up the Native roots and replacing them every year
with corn to provide to pigs and to distill into ethanol, the best use
of this landscape would be to turn it back into switchgrass prairie.
Ethanol production from switchgrass is about 5 to 6 times more efficient
than ethanol production from corn. And while currently the research is
directed at switchgrass monocultures, a true prairie flora could
probably be used for the purpose, too. A green economy for Iowa would
see the restoration of switchgrass prairies and the harvest of the grass
for ethanol production. That would also allow the restoration of roots
to the land and a diverse plant and animal habitat. Sustainably planted
islands of edible corn in this prairie instead of diminutive islands of
prairie in a desert of corn and soybeans would still produce food. In
the coming years, agriculture, just like everything else, will need to
adjust to massive changes in climate and in energy use. We all need to
re-learn to live with the land instead of against it. We will all need
to re-learn the value of roots and how to maintain them.
]{.CharOverride-1}

[I ]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[am not advocating for a return
to pre-industrial life; wind power generation will have to be a part of
the solution on the Plains and Prairies. Wind turbines are rooted like
prairie grasses and like the farmers who take care of the land. Instead
of clearing the land of its roots, however, and watch people, native
plants, animals, and everything else be swept away from it in the name
of industry, we should emphasize this caretaking function of farming. In
order to see prairie caretaking as farming, we need to redefine the
meaning of the term, farming. But farming as caretaking of the landscape
instead of industrial extraction of resources would restore the powers
of roots and enable those same roots to care for people. Instead of
seeing that as a threat to farmers, I see it as a restoration of the
true meaning of farming. Until industrialization, farming did not mean
to rip out roots, but planting roots and at the same time taking care of
existing root systems, nurturing the land for plants, animals, and
communities.]{.CharOverride-1}

[I]{.Letter-V_Drop-Cap .CharOverride-1}[ronically, people in exile are
experts on roots. What we have learned is that roots cannot be forced.
Roots need to grow naturally. If we allow them to grow, over time,
patiently, listening and observing and learning, then we will be able to
harvest their true energy.]{.CharOverride-1}
