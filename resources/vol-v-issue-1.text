> positive---*love, warmth, faith*. For me, the word community is in the

> I would rather not get into the definition game; books have been
> written about it. Maybe we can get away with saying, "you know
> community when you see it." In any event, for most people, most of the
> time, community conjures thoughts and feelings that are good,
> supportive, comfortable. Those who find it suf- focating to live in
> places where the person next door knows too much about them will
> generally not com- plain about community; instead, their complaint
> will center on small towns, on nosy neighbors, or on not having enough
> to do. In fact, we often hear and read laments about the decline of
> community feeling in the contemporary world. Most of us think it's
> good to live in a place that has a community feel about it, whether
> that place is an urban neighborhood, a rural church parish, or a

> Studies
> (htt[ps://w](http://www.grinnell.edu/)ww.gr[innell.edu/](http://www.grinnell.edu/)
> academics/centers-programs/prairie-studies), whose three guiding
> principles---as it says on our letterhead--- are *community,
> sustainability, and place*. By definition then, we at *Rootstalk* are
> interested in community---its meaning, its shape, and our ability to
> keep it healthy. What experiences create a feeling of community? What
> goals can bring a community together? What strains can divide a
> community? What role do memory and tradition play in maintaining a
> community?
>
> This issue of *Rootstalk* offers several pieces of con- tent that
> address such questions. The short essays by Bridget Brandt, Sam Cox,
> Randall Hotchkin, and Allan and Shirley Moyer in fact came out of a
> writing work- shop, centered on defining community, which we held last
> spring as part of a class at Grinnell College co-taught by
> *Rootstalk's* editor, Mark Baechtel, and myself. The stu- dents in our
> class first took their own writing workshop, facilitated by noted
> northeast Iowa writer and publish- er, Robert Wolf (whose new book,
> *Building the Agricul- tural City: A Handbook for Rural Renewal*
> [(h](http://www/)t[tp://www.](http://www/)
> robertwolfthewriter.com/books/building-the-agricul- tural-city), is
> reviewed in this issue by Fred Kirschen- mann). Bob, who has led
> writing workshops around the country, had each student share a
> personal story with the class. These oral stories became the basis for
> writing, as Bob coached each student in finding their voice and
> creating an engaging narrative structure. Next, we in- vited residents
> from the town of Grinnell (htt[ps://w](http://www/)ww.

> I\'m thinking about this phrase---particularly the *eight million

> convened last spring. Our workshop\'s participants in- cluded
> small-town politicians, a retired teacher, a social worker, a pair of
> retired farmers, a professional wood- worker, a coffee shop owner, and
> one of the town\'s bar- bers. While the stories they produced didn\'t
> quite add up to eight million, they were striking nonetheless for
> their variety, depth and poignancy. None of our work- shop
> participants were professional storytellers. And yet, by turns, they
> shared passages from their lives that were warm, funny, instructive,
> touching, and---to use a word that's much-overused these
> days---*diverse*. I was surprised.
>
> As I think of it now, though, I shouldn't have been. Having grown up

> cutting meat un- til he joined the Navy in 1951. In 1958, he married
> Pat Thigh, and they raised three children. His wife Pat passed away in

> racing to impress
>
> the hometown crowd, is a lost art of a long gone era in Grinnell,
> Iowa.

######## High Octane Beginnings

> I lived in the country and graduated from the eighth grade at Ewart
> School. I then moved to Grinnell with my folks. A second-hand bicycle
> was the incen- tive to attend high school. Before I ever got my
> license, I drove with my parents to "Seven Mile Corner," and a
> patrolman came along and stopped us. He said I was a good driver, but
> I was too short and, of course, had no license. He gave me a five
> dollar fine, which my fa- ther paid. In 1945, five dollars was quite a
> bit of money! When I finally got my license, I was restricted to
> sitting on a pillow when I drove.
>
> During high school, I bought a motorbike, which would reach upwards of
> 50 mph, but I didn't get my first "hot car" until I graduated in 1948:
> a 1932 Model B Ford, black. I had to pay for the car myself. Once
> outta' high school, I worked at Central Meat Market for \$30 a week
> cutting meat, and that's how I paid for it. The Ford had a V8 engine
> and spare wheels in each of the front fenders. At that time it was one
> of the fastest cars in Grinnell, and I thought it was real cool.
>
> Back then everybody would be downtown, just messing around. The girls
> would walk the block and the boys would "scoop the loop," driving real
> slow to show off their cars. We used to race anyone we could those
> nights. This was after people got done with work, be- cause, you see,
> everybody worked back then. You'd see
>
> somebody, pull up beside them and then ask if they'd wanna race.
> Chances were the other guy would be driv- ing the other way, and you'd
> just stop in the middle of the road and decide where you'd race to.
> Then, you'd go out to the edge of town, line up and take off, ending
> at Seven Mile Corner on the other edge of town. The Seven Mile Corner
> was the intersection of Highway 63 to Tama and Route Six to Malcom, a
> local landmark. The girls were young and silly and they'd always be
> two or three together. You'd always have buddies in the car with you.
> It was never a one-on-one thing. My friends would be rooting for me in
> the back of the car. We lost very few races in town.

######## Hot Hand

> I think we only had around three or four police then. The chief at the
> time was Glen Bell. I knew two of the local police pretty well. They
>
> racin', they'd probably be in big trouble. All he knew was that I had
> the hottest car in town.
>
> Unfortunately, "the hottest car in town" eventually came to an end.
> The car was light in the rear-end, which made it possible to slide it
> around corners fast without upsetting; however, the car had one big
> drawback: it was very hard on transmissions. You had to replace the
> transmissions at least half a dozen times, so it got to be almost
> second nature. Transmissions cost five dollars. That was a lot of
> money for back then, as I've already said. You'd have to go to the
> junkyard to get a replace- ment. It had to be a Ford transmission.
> Fortunately, the local junkyard kept me in good supply. A friend and I
> could change one out in two to three hours.
>
> Old Sam Berman ran the junkyard. I knew him real well, and he'd
> chatter like a chipmunk, but he knew what I wanted when I came. He
> didn't give me no dis-
>
> count; just wanted his five dollars.
>
> drove Pontiacs and always rode two in a car around town. Once in a
> while they would even play "ditchum" with us, with them "chasing" us
> around, but more often than not, we would end up "losing" them.
> Caution, do not try this at home kids!
>
> One officer lived two blocks down from me: he seemed big and
> intimidating back then. But he was about as close to being a buddy and
> as friendly as you could get, at least for a police officer. He knew
> what I did with my car. One time he caught me as I was racing my
> friend Jerry
>
> The officer wouldn't really say anything when I'd win. Makes sense,
> since if word got out they were
>
> racin', they'd probably be in big trouble. All he knew was that I had
>
> t[he hottest car in town.]{.underline}
>
> He'd have probably let me have it on credit, though, if I asked. The
> junk- yard used to be over where the Fare- way food store is now, near
> a ware- house for Meadow Gold ice cream, where they loaded into and
> out of trucks. The junkyard would buy old cars, iron and metal scraps,
> even an- imal hides. Back then they moved it all by hand or with
> trucks; now they've got big cranes.
>
> After two years the front frame finally broke, and I had to junk my
> beloved car out. The body ended up in my brother-in-laws hog lot! Tru-
>
> from this little hamburger joint, over where Lincoln Bank is now, and
> up Sixth Avenue. He caught me right about where the new library is.
> Jerry's dad had just got a new Oldsmobile. And the cop teased, "You've
> got a pretty poor car to be racing that new Oldsmobile," and I said,
> "Well, I bet I could take you!" And so we raced out to Seven Mile
> Corner. They couldn't go all the way out of town, but they'd go out at
> least three-quarters of a mile out of town to Lang's Dairy. Oh, I beat
> them a cou- pla times. The officer wouldn't really say anything when
> I'd win. Makes sense, since if word got out they were
>
> ly a sorry end to my first car.
>
> However, I didn't lose my love for speed and dan- ger as I raced a
> stock car, over at the Newton \[Iowa\]race track for two seasons.

######## High Stakes

> Back in the day, we'd race out in Newton where they had a
> fifth-of-a-mile track. I raced my friend's Chevy for him. It cost
> money to enter. They had prize money, and they charged people to come
> and watch. It used to be a pretty big deal; over a hundred people
>
> would be in the bleachers on every Saturday night. We'd work on it all
> day Saturday and then that night go and race. We'd fixed it back up
> again Sunday so it'd run. Ed- die Anderson, who had a body shop in
> Grinnell, even raced in big time races like the one at the State Fair,
> with actual race cars. I never did win much, and I even rolled my car
> once, but it was a lotta fun back then and a lotta folks did it.

######## A Family Affair

> My mom took my car to go visit a friend once. Since those 'hot cars'
> had manual brakes, you had to use your head and know what's ahead of
> you. It didn't have no hydraulic pressure, so it was almost as good as
> just
>
> dragging your foot to stop. You'd burn rubber taking off, but you
> couldn't really stop it. Well, she backed out of the driveway, and
> before she knew it she was halfway across the railroad tracks! She
> never asked to borrow my car again after that. The engine was also
> pretty loud. You'd take the muffler off and stick a straight pipe on
> it, but the cops didn't like that*---*kinda like my pickup sounds
> now*---*I always talk about fixing it, but my wife likes the sound.
>
> My grandson used to pull up beside us sometimes in town and we'd race
> as best we could. I didn't lose many of those either, even when I was
> racing him with my pickup. Fortunately, I don't get it by the police
> at all now. Don't think they ever got any trouble with me.

> camel at the bottom of the ramp. Weather was good and a few heaters
> made it comfort- able. The rooster crowed repeatedly through it all,
> and that was what people remembered. We enjoyed this for three years,

> to a nice part of our memories. The wedding came about from a request
> from our granddaughter, who wanted a Western wedding in the

> barn. Her fiance had friends in Missouri who brought their horses and
> camped in the timber. Their job was to park cars.The rehearsal dinner

> large crowd sat across the haymow and our friends sang all the wedding

> walked down the ramp from the barn a large black cloud was in the

> he Grinnell Area Arts Council (GAAC; https:// www.grinnellarts.org),
> located in the heart of downtown Grinnell, Iowa, is a community center
> that hosts exhibits, concerts, plays, celebrations, and classes. Of
> particular interest to me this past spring was "Studio 6," the Arts
> Council's Monday-through-Thursday after school program that attracts
> approximately 20 to 25 students. The kids attending Studio 6 come from
> differ- ent backgrounds in the town, and adult artist/mentors guide
> them in working with one another to create piec-
>
> es of art that reflect their cohesion as a classroom.
>
> During the spring class I was involved in, the Stu- dio 6 kids worked
> on a myriad of art projects. Some- times they paved their own paths in
> personal, individ- ual projects; sometimes they worked together to
> create something great and grand. In response to this issue's theme of
> community, I decided to explore how the chil- dren of the Studio 6
> classroom could represent their own definition of community in a
> mural. I reached out to GAAC staff member/teachers Katie In and Alesia
> Lacina and told them I was interested in doing a proj- ect. They
> excitedly agreed to spearhead a mural project where Studio 6 students
> would create an image that re- flected what community meant to them.
> Within weeks, we created mural-esque scenes on the classroom walls,
> and unleashed the kids to create.
>
> I went to two Studio 6 classes in which students produced two separate
> murals. Both had similar initial prompts, beginning with the depiction
> of large trees. Before we started the project, though, I talked with
> the students to help guide what this mural would look like.
>
> We prompted the students with questions like, "What do you think
> community is?"
>
> Interestingly, the two classes' differing concept of community was
> reflected in their answers, discussions, and later in the murals they
> created. The first class's dis- cussion emphasized sharing, peace, and
> caring for oth- ers. The second class's mural centered on the kids'
> ideas about who community members were, and explored the theme of
> working together. This group continually
>
> mentioned firefighters, police officers, and the idea of working
> together to "make something."
>
> Using images of the students' work and quotes from their commentary on
> community as they worked, I've traced this project from its beginnings
> through the finished project.

> The word "obituary" comes from the Latin obit, meaning death. Brief
> announcements of death were published in America as early as the 16th
> century. But not until the 19th century, and following a lead from the
> British, our obits became more detailed accounts, appearing with
> regularity in the press.

> At the time of the Civil War, obituaries for soldiers often included
> sentiment and religious overtones. This is also when embalming began

> the end of the century, "death journalism" emerged. Obituaries in both
> England and the United States focused on the graphic and often morbid
> details of the person's death, a trend that continued into the 20th
> century. Theodore Roosevelt, president from 1901-1909, died in his
> sleep at age 60. His obituary in *The New York Times (https://*

> A precious one is gone, A voice we loved is still,

Mammals of the Prairie: American Mink
=====================================

#### Neovison vison

> he **American mink** is a semi-aquatic animal endemic throughout much
> of North America.
>
> A member of the *Mustelidae* family, it is related to the otter,
> badger, marten, weasel, ferret, and wolverine, and like them is an
> aggressive carnivore, hunting rodents, fish, crustaceans, frogs, and
> birds. Male minks measure from 13 to 18 inches in body length, and
> weigh one to three pounds, while females usually measure from 12 to 15
> inches and weigh between one and two pounds. The mink's long
> streamlined body allows it to enter the bur- rows of prey and helps to
> reduce water resistance while it's swimming.
>
> Though Mustelid species vary greatly in size, minks are typically
> small animals with short legs, short round ears, and thick fur which
> tends to be various shades of tawny, from dark to light, with color
> very evenly distrib- uted over the body and a white chin and lower
> lip.
>
> **Vocalization**: The American mink has a variety of sounds in its
> repertoire, including screams, whining peeps, hisses, squeals, grunts,
> and cries, and even a sort of "quacking bark."
>

> Janssen has been committed to helping consumers better understand the

> last Spring to give a comprehensive talk about some of her findings.
> During her presentation she debunked many of the myths we
>
> as consumers embrace concerning how healthy and safe the local foods
> movement really is. Farming is an incredibly strenuous occupation and
> unfortunately many of the economic, physical, and mental stressors
> farmers endure are not acknowledged by the very people consuming the
> fruits of their labor. In order to fully understand the labor that
> goes into bringing crop from farm to table it is imperative that we
> learn about what goes on behind the scenes. Janssen goes into detail
> about the process of accessing labor, how farmer and farmer's market
> relationships work, and the alarming ways in which agricultural labor
> puts
>
> farmers at high risk for mental and emotional distress.

##### The Commons

> In 2009, Elinor Ostrom (https://en.wikipedia.org/ wiki/Elinor\_Ostrom)
> won the Nobel Prize in Econom- ic Sciences for the decades of work she
> spent demon- strating that groups of people around the world can and
> do sustainably manage natural resources by develop- ing and using
> their own de facto systems of rules and norms grounded in local
> cultural and ecological con- texts. Summarizing the findings of Ostrom
> and her col- leagues, David Bollier (http://www.bollier.org) states,
> "In a commons, the structural pressures to earn mon- ey are reduced
> and the incentives to take into account subtle, long-term factors are
> greater. As a social insti- tution, a commons is also more likely to
> care about the long-term sustainability of a resource than the market,
>
> alone. Hardin's parable suggested that, in the absence of the
> incentives of individualized private property or the sanctions of
> centralized government authorities, humans in communities are
> inherently selfish, short sighted, and incapable of using resources
> sustainably over the long term.
>
> Hardin's argument was a cogent and relatively re- cent manifestation
> of a longstanding line of thought regarding land management.
> Translated into policy, including the appropriation and enclosure of
> Native American prairie commons and the increasing scale,
> mechanization, and corporatization of Midwestern ag- riculture, this
> line of thought has led to a century and a half of private and
> government mismanagement of the prairies. Indeed, it has led to their
> near elimination and destruction as described in Connie Mutel's
> masterful treatise on the prairies, *The Emerald Horizon: The His-
> tory of Nature in Iowa*
> (htt[ps://w](http://www.uipress.uiowa.edu/)ww.ui[press.uiowa.edu/](http://www.uipress.uiowa.edu/)
> books/9781587296321/the-emerald-horizon). Howev- er, the recent
> history of the prairies is not only one of destruction and
> mismanagement. In her book, Mutel also documents multiple public and
> private initiatives to preserve and restore the prairies, but none of
> them takes the form of the community-based commons ap- proach that
> characterizes Dancing Rabbit.

> wish to explore their efforts to simultaneously restore prairie
> ecosystems and develop productive human landscapes through cooperative

##### Dancing Rabbit Ecovillage

> Dancing Rabbit is an intentional community of approximately 60 people,
> founded in the mid-1990s in Scotland County, northeast Missouri. The
> nomencla- ture "ecovillage" is used by many contemporary inten- tional
> communities to define their collective identity and indicate their
> shared commitment to living in more ecologically sustainable ways. The
> term first appeared in the 1970s, but its popularization is most
> commonly at-
>
> ment and can be successfully continued into the indef- inite future"
> (cited in Dawson 2006:13). This definition has since been revised and
> added to multiple times. On its website, the Global Ecovillage Network
> (https:// ecovillage.org), an organization that helps ecovillages
> around the world network with one another, states that "\[a\]n
> ecovillage is an intentional, traditional or urban community that is
> consciously designed through locally owned, participatory processes in
> all four dimensions of sustainability (social, culture, ecology,
> economy into a whole systems design) to regenerate its social and nat-
> ural environment." In general, deliberate, collaborative,
> multi-dimensional approaches to living in more eco- logically
> sustainable manners are defining features of ecovillages, especially
> in more affluent countries of the world.
>
> From the beginning, the Rabbits adopted this mis- sion statement: "To
> create a society, the size of a small town or village, made up of
> individuals and commu- nities of various sizes and social structures,
> which al-
>
> lows and encourages its members to live sustainably. To encourage this
> sustainable society to grow to have the size and recognition necessary
> to have an influence on the global community by example, education,
> and research". The community includes the local ecosystem in its
> definition of the term 'sustainable'. As the com- munity's mission
> statement goes on to state, living sus- tainably involves living "in
> such a manner that, within the defined area, no resources are consumed
> faster than their natural replenishment, and the enclosed system can
> continue indefinitely without degradation of its in- ternal resource
> base or the standard of living of the peo- ple and the rest of the
> ecosystem within it." Deliberately situating themselves relative to
> both the local and the global, both the human and the
> other-than-human, is a defining feature of these Rabbits' commons
> endeavor. For the last decade, I have been part of a team of
> researchers that has been working with the Rabbits to help them assess
> their progress toward sustainable liv- ing. We have done this by
> measuring their consump- tion of resources and their experienced
> well-being, and comparing these measures with those of mainstream
> American society. Our results indicate that, in many
>
> key areas, they are living on about 10 percent of the resources used
> by the average American, while main- taining about the same
> experienced quality of life \[see Lockyer 2017
> (https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.
> php/JPE/article/view/20890/20480)\] for a full analysis and
> interpretation of our results.
>
> As part of this work, I also turned my attention to the community's
> land use and land management prac- tices, along with the ways in which
> the community is transforming its collectively held landscape. One of
> the community's goals is to restore a parcel of degraded farmland as a
> functioning prairie ecosystem that is able to sustainably provide for
> many of their needs while also creating habitat for the many
> other-than-human prairie inhabitants that used to be so ubiquitous
> here. In this article, I make no attempt to quantitatively measure

> or at restoring prairie ecosystems; rath- er, my aim is simply to

> restoration and reforestation.

##### Urban Development

> As Connie Mutel indicates in *The Emerald Hori- zon*, the parceling of
> prairie landscapes into individu- alized portions for agriculture and
> urban development has been a key driver of the prairie ecosystem
> destruc- tion. When Dancing Rabbit acquired its acreage in the
>
> mid-1990s, the land was a post-industrial farmscape that had not been
> farmed for over ten years and includ- ed only a few buildings left
> over from previous decades of industrial farming.
>
> In order to allow the majority of the community's land to heal, the
> Rabbits agreed to build their com- munity infrastructure on only a
> small portion of their land. Current urban development is contained
> within approximately twenty acres, with plans to expand to forty acres
> (see Figure 4). In the early years, the chal- lenge was simply to
> provide housing, but throughout Dancing Rabbit's history, community
> members have paid attention not only to their physical footprint on
> their land, but also to the embedded energy contained in the building
> materials they use. In addition to having a small geographic
> footprint, houses are constructed us- ing a variety of natural and
> green building techniques, often incorporating locally available
> materials such as straw bales, clay, and reclaimed lumber. As a
> result, a dense cluster of eclectic buildings has grown up on the
> southeast corner of the land.
>
> Through its land use planning and leaseholding process, the community
> contin- ues to update and revise policies regarding the use of space,
> includ- ing the placement of foot and cart paths (vehicles are kept on
> the village perimeter, except under exceptional circumstances, often
> involving construction), the orien- tation of buildings to roads and
> to each other, and the incorporation of green space into the urban
> area. The overall aim is to create a dense- ly populated urban village
> on one small corner of the acreage.
>
> Planning for the development of a commons in a way that consid- ers
> the needs of both current and future residents is, as the commu-
> nity's website indicates "\[a\]n ongo- ing challenge," given "the

##### Agricultural Development

> As the Rabbits increasingly met their needs for shelter during the
> early years, many of them were able to turn their focus to producing
> food for themselves and their community. This has entailed
> rehabilitating land that, while fallow since 1987, was degraded by de-
> cades of industrial corn and hog farming. In addition to residential
> leaseholds, the community has garden lease- holds where people produce
> food for the households and the kitchen cooperatives they are part of,
> as well as commercial agricultural leaseholds where people produce
> food for sale to their fellow community mem- bers and residents of
> surrounding areas. Currently, the members of the village have
> designated fifty acres for food production, much of which is yet to be
> developed. Food produced using standard industrial methods employed on
> private property, but organized according
>
> leagues have documented more sustainable land use practices and food
> production systems in many suc- cessful commons institutions. At
> Dancing Rabbit, ag- ricultural development proceeds according to
> models much more in the latter vein than in the former. The scale of
> production at Dancing Rabbit is smaller and more diverse, often
> integrating multiple species into a field and sometimes, as in the
> case of forest gardens, in- tegrating wild and domesticated species
> into the same plot. Permaculture, a design philosophy for human food
> production that is based on working with natural forces rather than
> against them, underlies many Rab- bits' approach to food production.
> While such systems have the direct and immediate benefit of producing
> food for people, they are also designed with an eye to
> interconnections and indirect benefits such as fostering habitat for
> wildlife that may be hunted, and to restoring

> tion Reserve Program (CRP). Administered by the Farm Ser- vice Agency,
> CRP pays farmers and landowners to remove en- vironmentally sensitive
> tracts of land from agricultural produc- tion with the goals of
> improv- ing water quality, preventing soil erosion, and preventing the
> loss of wildlife habitat. Most of Dancing Rabbit's efforts at prai-
> rie ecosystem restoration are undertaken on its CRP acreage. Thus, in
> addition to catego-
>
> ries of land specifically set aside for urban development and ag-
> riculture, Dancing Rabbit has a category of land labelled 'Pri-
> oritized for Ecosystem Health'. Land management which pri- oritizes
> ecosystem health is part of the community's efforts to balance the
> needs of the human and other-than-human inhabi- tants of their land.
> According to the community's website, "This
>
> soil fertility over the long-term.
>
> A small number of Rabbits incorporate rotation- al grazing into their
> approach to food production and land management. While many Rabbits
> choose to be vegan or vegetarian as part of their sustainable living
> philosophy, a number of them recognize that prairie ecosystems are
> particularly appropriate contexts for the production of animal
> protein. They deliberately use animal agriculture in an attempt to
> mimic the role of grazing herbivores such as bison in the Pre-Colombi-
> an prairies. It is here that the Rabbits' approach to food production
> overlaps with their efforts at prairie ecosys- tem restoration.

##### Prairie Ecosystem Restoration

> Of Dancing Rabbit's 280 total acres, 160 acres are managed through the
> federal government's Conserva-
>
> is the area in which we will encourage and assist in eco- system
> health, stability and resiliency. This area consists of all Dancing
> Rabbit property not... \[designated for urban or agricultural
> development\]. We expect to es- tablish native species, stabilize
> soil, encourage diversity and control invasive non-native species....
> We've plant- ed native grasses on over 15 acres and have been main-
> taining them with regular prescribed burns, an essential part of the
> prairie's life cycle. We hope to rebuild the diversity of plots by
> replanting patches of the few native wildflowers and grasses that can
> still be found in north- east Missouri. While we do not work directly
> on wild- life management of native animals, our land provides a
> sanctuary from the expanding farms, roads and towns elsewhere."
> (Dancing Rabbit Ecovillage 2015)
>
> Dancing Rabbit members have undertaken to in- form themselves about
> their land's history and the de- structive transformation of the North
> American prairies
>
> in general. The community's common library includes dozens of books
> focused on related subjects, and the community's approach to healing
> the land is a frequent topic of conversation. During an interview with
> me as part of our research project, one community member described a
> meeting with a long-time local farmer who informed him that Dancing
> Rabbit's land was "proba- bly the most over-grazed, over-farmed piece
> of land in the county." For many decades, the land was used for
> industrial scale commodity food production, primarily for corn and
> hogs, which eliminated most natural com- ponents of the prairies and
> degraded the soil. Studies of attempts to allow prairies to recover
> from industrial farming show that prairies can be so degraded, they
> of- ten only further degenerate when left to the natural suc- cession
> process; prairies require human intervention for successful
> conservation and restoration (Mutel 2008). Dancing Rabbit therefore
> desires to actively steward the healing of the land rather than
> passively abandon it to natural processes of succession. While not all
> Rabbits agree on the best approach to doing this, the communi- ty's
> land-use planning committee and Dancing Rabbit's forums for collective
> governance provide
>
> venues for decision making about the com- munity's continuously
> evolving approach to prairie stewardship and restoration, which at
> this writing includes in-progress resto- ration of over 15 acres of
> native grasslands. Another collective initiative under- taken by
> Rabbits, with the aim of restoring prairie ecosystem health and
> expanding native biodiversity, involves reforestation. Original
> prairies in this part of the coun- try included oak-dominated
> woodlands, especially along watercourses, where the effects of natural
> and man-made fire were minimized and where more moisture was available
> (Mutel 2008). These woodlands were cut back as industrial agricultural
> fields expanded, starting especially in the mid-twentieth century.
> Over the years, the Rabbits have planted over 15,000 individual
>
> using controlled burns and other methods.
>
> One Dancing Rabbit member who is heavily in- volved in the land use
> planning committee has estimat- ed that the community is gaining, on
> average, an acre of forest each year through the expansion of remnant
> woodlands and the maturation of tree plantings. This has resulted in
> some of Dancing Rabbit's land falling out of eligibility for the
> Conservation Reserve Program, as forested land is not in a condition
> to go back into agricultural production.
>
> During my visit to Dancing Rabbit in the summer of 2018, it became
> clear that unprecedented drought conditions were driving decisions
> that would have un- foreseen impacts on the community's efforts at
> prairie ecosystem restoration. In July 2018, the community granted a
> neighboring farmer's request to use tractors to produce desperately
> needed hay for his cattle from the 160 acres of land which the
> community had allocat- ed to the Conservation Reserve Program. Some
> com- munity members were dubious about the impact this would have on

##### Discussion

> During two centuries of Euro-American colo- nization, the prairies
> were largely destroyed through processes of agricultural and urban
> development. The community at Dancing Rabbit Ecovillage is trying to
> re- store a small portion of the prairies while also produc- ing food
> and developing an urban area on its parcel of degraded prairie
> farmland. The community's practices of agricultural and urban
> development, quite different from those so predominantly employed
> elsewhere in
>
> into a restored, diverse prairie ecosystem while also en- gaging in
> productive activities that met human needs? The current answer is
> almost certainly "only partially." However, just as the destruction of
> the prairies was a long-term project, so will be their restoration. As
> a re- searcher and Dancing Rabbit board member with long- term
> familiarity with the community, I aim to help develop future
> collaborative research projects at the community. Such projects may
> include helping them to monitor ecological restoration---soil testing,
> grass, flower, & tree species inventories, and wildlife monitor- ing,
> among other activities directly relevant to prairie ecosystem
> restoration. At the same time, we will con- tinue to monitor if and
> how the Rabbits are able to meet their needs from the land in
> sustainable ways that lessen their impact on ecosystems elsewhere.
>
> How much food, fuel, fiber, and building materials are they able to
> harvest from the land, while continuing their efforts toward prairie
> ecosystem restoration? Can the Rabbits find a sustainable balance
> between devel- opment for a growing community and ecological res-
> toration? Only time will tell, but I hope that ongoing research can
> lend a crucial hand in helping the com- munity achieve its goals and
> demonstrate that people in modern western societies can still find
> ways to cooper- atively and sustainably manage the commons. Scientists

##### Conclusion

> I'd like to close with a quotation from Wendell Berry
> (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendell\_Ber- ry), a poet, farmer,
> professor and philosopher who has spent much of his life reflecting on
> what is required for a healthy relationship between people and land in
> American culture, and particularly in the agricultural Midwest.
> Although Berry uses the term 'local culture' in this quotation, I
> think he is really talking about a 'local commons' such as the one
> Dancing Rabbit is creating.
>
> The loss of local culture is, in part, a practi- cal loss and an
> economic one. For one thing, such a culture contains, and conveys to
> succeeding gen- erations, the history of the use of the place and the
> knowledge of how the place may be lived in and used. For another, the
> patterns of reminding im- plies affection for the place and respect
> for it, and so, finally, the local culture will carry the knowledge of
> how the place may be well and lovingly used, and also the implicit
> command to use it only well and lovingly. The only true and effective
> 'operator's
>
> manual for spaceship earth' is not a book that any human will ever
> write; it is hundreds of thousands of local cultures.
>
> Wendell Berry 1990: 166.
>
> Dancing Rabbit is only in the beginning stages of creating its local
> commons. The community's acts of commoning involve developing
> knowledge, respect, and affection for its place and its landscape so
> that it may be lived in "well and lovingly used" across the gen-
> erations. Conducting research at Dancing Rabbit over the last ten
> years, I have seen this creation emerging in the way community members
> spend time deliberately observing, interacting with, learning from,
> and stew- arding both their landscape and their community. I see it in
> the fact that they often name their buildings after native prairie
> species that may disappear if their habitats are not restored. But
> perhaps the best measure of their success or failure in creating a
> local commons will only be revealed in the actions and choices of the
> younger generation currently being raised in this com- munity and on
> its common land.

> **Matt*: ***One of the cool things with the art center and the

> **Sarah:** When we moved to Oskaloosa we noticed there was kind of an

>
> **Matt:** There's a lot of elements to it, and really, the sculpture

>
> **Sarah:** It's just a grassroots group of women that just pull their

>
> **Sarah:** It was difficult in a lot of ways.

> **Matt:** You know, we're artists. Artists need a commu- nity to work

Mammals of the Prairie: Virginia Opossum
========================================

#### Didelphis virginiana

> he **Virginia opossum**---also known as the North American
> opossum---is the only
>
> marsupial north of Mexico. It's solitary, nocturnal, about the size of
> a house cat and all-too-familiar to many homeowners (along with the
> racoon) as a highly successful raider of garbage cans.
>
> The opossum has a number of unique phys- ical characteristics. In
> addition to the brooding pouch it shares in common with other
> marsupials, it has 50 teeth---more than any other North Ameri- can
> land mammal---opposable, clawless thumbs on their rear limbs, and a
> naked, prehensile tail. The animal is thought to have evolved in South
> Ameri- ca, but migrated north during the Great American Interchange
> (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great\_ American\_Interchange). Until
> recently, its range extended from Central America to the norther U.S.,
> however climate change appears to be further extending its range into
> southern Canada.

> **Vocalization:** The opossum has a voice appropriate to its retiring
> nature. Opossums are mostly quiet, but if provoked will hiss or make a
> grinding cry of warning.

>
> To begin, let's travel back in time 122 years ago to a coal seam in
> Monroe County, Iowa, owned by the Consolidation Coal Co. of Chicago.
> The town that grew up around the mine, Buxton2 (near present day
> Albia), was named eponymously for its manager, Ben C. Bux- ton. That
> was where my great-grandparents, Ross and Blanche Johnson, arrived
> from Virginia in 1895. Why did they travel so far?
>
> To understand why my grandparents and other African Americans
> perceived Iowa as a place of refuge, we have to understand the
> conditions they endured in 1890's Virginia. In the year 1894, African
> Americans were actually the majority of the population of Albemar- le
> County, Virginia. (The county was home to 606 free Blacks and 13,916
> enslaved African Americans, com- pared to 12,103 Whites.) Of course,
> fear of that Black majority engendered the kinds of naked oppression
> you might expect from those dedicated to maintaining White supremacy
> by any means necessary. Segregation was the rule in every area of
> Charlottesville public life.
>
> Ross Johnson, my great-grandfather was well aware of social,
> vocational and economic lines that could or could not be crossed. Even
> a casual review of
>
> what my ancestors endured in Jim Crow Virginia serves to underline the
> hope and possibility that buoyed them on their journey out of the
> South. During the Civil War, Iowa had been on the Union side of things
> (thank good- ness!) and so this land was blessed with a somewhat more
> progressive, humanistic perspective than, say, Missouri or the states
> that had been in the Confedera- cy. So, Ross and Blanch Porter Johnson
> left Charlottes- ville in 1893 for coal mining work on the Iowa
> prairie. My grandmother, Lettie Porter Thompson, was born in Monroe
> County on November 19, 1896.
>
> As a child in Iowa, Lettie experienced a totally dif- ferent social
> matrix than the one she would've endured in Charlottesville. That is
> not to say her family mem- bers didn't experience reduced
> opportunities because of their skin color, but life was materially
> better in Iowa if for no other reason than that they were able to take

###### My Parents Meet

> My father, Philadel-
>
> Getting along with people of any ethnici- ty was the hallmark of
>
> dartanyan's grandmother, lettIe Porter thomPson
>
> phia-born Ellsworth T. Brown, met my mother, Mary Alice Thompson,
>
> my grandmother's philosophy of life. She lived it and
>
> wouldn't tolerate any derogatory talk about anyone. When I was a
> youngster, my parents would go for drives, visiting friends both Black
> and White in little commu- nities outside of Des Moines. Mom and Dad
> would pack my two brothers (Kevan and Don) and me into dad's beloved
> '55 Dodge and head off to Albia, Marshalltown, Perry or somewhere else
> where the family had friends from the Buxton days.
>
> I remember hearing about The Buxton Club3, a so-
>
> in Los Angeles after the Second World War. Mom was studying music at
> Los Angeles City College and working as an extruder at Lockheed
> Aircraft when dad returned stateside after his wartime duties in the
> Merchant Ma- rine. They got married in early 1949. A few months be-
> fore I was due to be born, Mom decided that she wanted to be near her
> family. Ellsworth and Mary left L.A. and moved back to Iowa---just in
> time for me to arrive in October of 1949 at Mercy Hospital.
>
> We lived at 1434 Walker Street on Des Moines'
>
> east side. It was integrated like Buxton was, and we had lots of
> Jewish, African-American, Latino and Europe- an-American neighbors.
>
> In the mid-50s the Walker Street house was a hub for rehearsals, jam
> sessions, and music lessons for stu- dents like 16-year-old Frank
> Perowsky4 who left Des Moines to forge an incredible career as an
> arranger, in- strumentalist, studio musician and recording artist in
> New York City. Dad even had a system you could use to press your own
> recordings5 from blank vinyl discs. (Don't ask me how that worked!!)
>
> Ernest "Speck" Redd6---originally from Hanni- bal, Missouri---while
> certainly not the only good piano player, was the most respected
> African American jazz piano player of the 50s and 60s in Des Moines.
> Because he lived three blocks down Walker Street from us, there were
> frequent music sessions involving him and my fa- ther. Charlie Parker7
> was the reigning king of Jazz at that time, and I remember spirited
> discussions between the musicians about how to interpret Bird's
> musical in- novations. Speck was posthumously inducted into the Des
> Moines Community Jazz Center (CJC) Jazz Hall of Fame8 in 2005. My
> dad's induction came in 2010.
>
> Dad was a bebopper (bebop9 being a kind of jazz introduced during the
> 1940s by innovators like Charlie Parker); Mom loved Rhumba, Merengue,
> and Europe- an Classical music of all kinds. I was im- mersed in these
> sounds, almost inundat- ed with them, from the time I was born. I
> would sing (Mom would call it yowling) along with records---no matter
> what style.
>
> Though my parents later divorced and for a time my father drifted out
> of my life, this was a time when I gained my ba- sic appreciation for
> ALL music dedicated to telling stories and bringing healing to our
> beleaguered souls.

###### My early exposure to technology

> has a significant, though different, meaning in the world of

>
> My father was familiar with both the social and the mathematical
> contexts for integration. Ellsworth had been one of the few Black
> radio officers in the Merchant Marine during WWII. Dad integrated his
> aptitude for mathematics into his love of music, and this led him to
> the Schillinger System of Musical Composition10. Years later, at my
> father's induction into the Iowa Jazz Hall of Fame, I learned from his
> friends in attendance that he brought musicians to our Walker Street
> house to teach them the Schillinger System.
>
> Music, mathematics and technology were com- pletely integrated in my
> father's mind. In my 20s, when I encountered the writings of R.
> Buckminster Fuller11, I found someone who could clearly articulate
> complicat- ed ideas in the same way my father could. Bucky's *Op-
> erating Manual for Spaceship Earth*12 was an inspiration, and it
> remains an inspiration to this day.
>
> Dad also collected radios, and the pieces in his collection were

> section of North America. Then came America's westward expansion, and
> the huge herds were nearly exterminated, dwindling to less than 550
> animals by 1889. Strenuous conservation efforts brought the bison back

> been trimmed back along the sidewalk which flanks it on the west.

> **The Notion of North**
>
> My parents wished away their lives
>
> in their winter States over moving south to Florida or west to the
> California coast. But I dreamed of north, always north.
>
> I knew just where I'd go---North Dakota:
>
> First to Bowbells then across the border at Portal, and on along the
> railroad trunk line to Churchill by Hudson Bay.
>
> Then east across Quebec to Chicoutimi where Highway 175 makes a circle
> around the town as if giving travelers
>
> a chance to escape before overstaying
>
> their welcome. Towns I'd visit for no other reason except for the
> sounds of their names.
>
> Places I read from the Texaco roadmaps
>
> I saved like other kids collected baseball cards: Moose Jaw, Flin
> Flon, Saskatoon, Yellow Knife.
>
> I'd stop in cities I couldn't pronounce on a bet: Antigonish, Cocagne,
>
> Tatamogoosh, Musquodoboit, and of course,
>
> Middle Musquodoboit. I knew I could
>
> sow my wild, winter oats in Fertile, Saskatchwan,
>
> and that they'd have a parade for me in Welcome, Ontario.
>
> That I'd sit for a while, find my karma in Peace River until I finally
> made it to Paddle Prairie where it stays light all night in summer.
> I'd travel these towns
>
> where rumor has it that ponds freeze
>
> over in September, where the only two seasons
>
> are winter and the first of August, where they won't let you play
> hockey unless you speak fluent French.
>
> A guy once told me it was so boring in Newfoundland
>
> that the only things to do was drink, watch television and screw and I
> remember thinking: *What else could one want?*

> or the past decade my artwork and research has focused on 'edgelands,'
> from a forest in Massachusetts bordering a subdivision to a ragged
> prai- rie in Minnesota running along a railyard. Edgelands act like
> scrims rendering other spaces invisible, yet the edgelands are absent
> from most city maps. This waver- ing visibility seeps into my
> photographs and drawings: the soft villous hairs on the unfurling fern
> fronds are partially obscured by a puddle of green paint. Edge- lands
> are considered one of the last refuges of wildness. I photograph and
> draw the plants I discover in these overgrown patches of "weeds" as
> the seasons change. My images are as much about making visible this
> over- looked landscape as they are about documenting the
>
> passage of time.
>
> "The Prairie Constructs" are an ongoing series
>
> which catalogs the life and death of plants from the ed- gelands of
> Minneapolis. Made almost entirely on the scanner bed, The Prairie
> Constructs are a digital version of a photogram or botanical solar
> print. The images are shown as both large-scale digital color prints
> and as an artist book or compendium, showing the evolution in the
> landscape over the course of a year. What started as a way of
> collecting bits and pieces of plants as the seasons change has turned
> into a methodical and some- times frenetic project of gathering and
> experimenting with each plant.
>
> Since I often uncover synthetic materials, plastic bags mostly, as I
> collect plants I included these in the images as well.
>
> Chance also plays an important role because the view from below of the
> scanner is not visible until the
>
> image appears on my screen. I place my materials within the frame and
> then document them as they re- act and evolve (melt, flow, crumple,
> wilt), often making multiple scans from a single combination of paint,
> photographs, plants and plastics. I orchestrate this "organic process"
> that is then recorded and amplified through digital technology.
>
> Light is an important ingredient in the transformation of my materials
> and in the elevation of these spaces. I work with light when
> photographing the landscape, making the scans and installing the
> images. In traditional landscape painting, light can be in- terpreted
> as *lumen*, observed light, or *lux*, divine light or the light of
> rea- son. I prefer to think about light in terms of Heidegger's
> description of *lichtung*, which translates as "light in a forest
> clearing." He argues that openness must precede *lumen* and *lux*,
> observation and judgment. My work enables me to be open to the natural
> world that is around me, even in the city. It is this sense of wonder
> and awareness about the persistence of urban nature that I want to
> pass on to viewers through my images.

> provides us with an alternative vision of rural America that, to many
> of us, may seem an impos- sible fiction in light of what writer and
> critic Wendell Berry (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendell\_Berry)
> decried as the "unsettling of America." This "unset- tling" is a

> rural and urban lo- cales. It may cause most of us---especially those
> living in rural areas---to believe that any alternative, positive
> future for rural America, like the one Wolf envisions, simply defies
> reality.

> Nevertheless, in this inspiring book, Wolf provides

>
> Regionalism is precisely the means by which we can reconstruct society

> are, in fact, already happening in many parts of the world.
>
> Of course, communities across the U.S. have been heavily influenced by
> the culture of the Green Revo- lution, which envisioned, and created,
> a food system designed to feed the world with cheap food produced by
> fewer farmers, thereby producing an industrial, in- put-intensive food
> system designed for "maximum, ef- ficient, production, for short-term
> economic return." The Green Revolution's proponents claim that bio-re-

> ought to be enough to ensure its attractiveness. Wolf views this

> Wolf provides us with a different scenario, point- ing out some of the
> many reasons why the industrial food system is already beginning to
> "approach collapse" and is likely to include "chaos and violence" when
> it col- lapses. It is imperative, he argues, that we explore an al-
> ternative food system and begin building it.

> Of course, one of the many drivers of the Green Revolution model---as
> well as our enthusiasm sur- rounding it---was our collective
> assumption that the
>
> natural capital would always be there, throughout our industrial
> economy---and that new technologies would constantly be developed to
> replace it. Components of this natural capital would be healthy soil,
> cheap miner- als, plentiful fossil fuels, and abundant fresh
> water---all essential to the "success" of our Green Revolution food
> system.
>
> Now we are beginning to recognize that many as- pects of this natural
> capital are in a state of depletion. As Wolf notes early in the book,
> "one of the distinguishing features of contemporary American
> civilization is the frequency of breakdowns and failures in industry,
> gov- ernment, and society itself. The size of the problem is
> enormous."
>
> Take, for example, minerals. Rock phosphate--- which is the "natural
> capital" from which we manufac- ture our phosphorus inputs---is now
> depleted to a point where we only have perhaps another ten
> year's-worth of supply remaining on the planet. Or soil. Since we have
> paid little attention to restoring the health of our soils in our
> input-intensive systems, we need large quantities of fresh water for
> irrigation. This is due to the fact that most of our soils now only
> absorb about a half an inch
>
> of rain water per hour, so we now use approximately 70 percent of our
> freshwater resources on the planet for ag- ricultural irrigation. All
> of this, of course, is beginning to increase costs and produce
> diminishing returns---es- pecially for farmers. In his recent book,
> *Growing a Rev- olution: Bringing Our Soil Back to Life*
> (https://books. wwnorton.com/books/detail.aspx?id=4294995584), David
> Montgomery provides concrete evidence of how some farmers are already
> beginning to alter their farm- ing systems because the input-intensive
> systems simply no longer produce positive economic returns for them.
> Instead of continuing to rely on external inputs, which are becoming
> more costly, they are beginning to employ practices that restore the
> natural capital, reducing the need for the inputs. These farmers are
> now reducing their costs, increasing their net profits, and are no
> lon- ger interested in "getting bigger."
>
> This begins to make clear why the revolution Rob- ert Wolf envisions
> is a practical necessity. Even if we only consider cheap energy,
> minerals, soil and water as part of the natural capital that has
> "sustained" our in- dustrial agriculture for the past century, we must
> recog- nize that they are all in a state of depletion. As Wolf duly
>
> Photo by jon andelson
>
> noted throughout his treatise, our industrial economy will, at best,
> only survive for another two or three decades:
>
> The centralization of American government, fi- nance, and industry has
> grown extreme, to the extent that it governs our life and work. Such a
> system cannot long endure, and our various en- vironmental and social
> breakdowns are evidence of an ongoing crisis... Our institutions and
> corpo- rations have grown too large: everything exceeds human scale
> and has become inhuman. It is im- perative that we construct political
> and economic units in which people can once again find a home (page
> 23).
>
> This search for a home, for the reconstruction of our self-reliance,
> is the compelling reason that Wolf 's vision for the renewal of rural
> America, beginning with arks of refuge from industrial capitalism in
> places like the Driftless Region of the Upper Midwest, may seem
> strange to those of us still locked into the culture of the industrial
> economy. Wolf, looking back in our collective history, demonstrates
> how "early American history is replete with examples of local and
> regional self-reliance, from the Spanish Southwest to Yankee New
> England, from Chesapeake Bay to the Carolinas and Georgia." Returning
> to that kind of regional self-reliance can play a central role in
> deconstructing the highly problematic political economy in which we
> live.
>
> Those still not convinced may want to examine yet another recent
> publication by two of our leading agro- ecologists, Peter Rosset and
> Miguel Altieri: *Agroecolo- gy: Science and Politics*
> (https://developmentbookshop. com/agroecology-science-and-politics)*.*
> Rosset and Altieri highlight the key fact that the majority of food
> that feeds the global population in today's world is be- ing produced
> by smallholder farmers farming five acres or less! Going further,
> Rosset and Altieri point out that those smallholder farmers are
> already employing, and have been for millennia, the very kind of
> agro-ecolog- ical farming practices---grounded in "local autonomy,
> local markets and community action"---that Wolf envi- sions for a
> future America. Finally, it is also important to recognize that these
> "agro-ecological" farming prac-
>
> tices, which Rosset and Altieri describe, are operating as
> "human-centered cultures" driven by community relationships, not by
> machine-like alternative perime- ter cultures that humans have to
> conform to---exactly the kind of human-centered culture that Wolf
> envisions for the Driftless region (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
> Driftless\_Area) and eventually America's future.
>
> Finally, as we anticipate these future changes, Wolf suggests we
> embrace not more *technology*, but more *imagination*. Therefore, the
> arts can play a critical role in helping us to envision and adapt to
> this new future:
>
> *Regionalism fosters a regional culture.* Regionalism promotes the
> arts as a means of maintaining re- gional consciousness. Regional
> consciousness in turn fosters a willingness to work together, which in
> turn creates wealth (page 39).
>
> From my perspective, Wolf 's book is filled with important
> information---information that is vital for all of us to digest as we
> anticipate the changes coming at us, so that we can get an advanced
> start in preparing for them. Furthermore, by beginning to construct a
> few "arks" here and there, it becomes possible to demon- strate that
> the kind of human-centered, agro-ecological community farming which is
> already "feeding much of the world" could thrive in America. Doesn't
> that seem like a good way to start this transformation?

Mammals of the Prairie: the White-tailed Deer
=============================================

#### Odocoileus virginianus

> he white-tailed deer is widespread in the prairie region. It's natural
> range stretches from Canada
>
> south through the continental U.S., Mexico, and the countries of
> Central and South America, down to Peru and Bolivia. The female---the
> doe---usually
>
> weighs under 100 lbs, but can range up to nearly 200 lbs. The
> male---the buck---usually weighs around 100 lbs, though specimens
> approaching 300 lbs have been known. Bucks are distinguished also by
> antlers, which they shed and regrow yearly, and use to engage other
> bucks in antler-to-antler pushing contests during the mating season,
> usually late October to early November.
>
> On the prairie, the introduction of large-scale agri- culture and the
> clearcutting of coniferous forests, along with the virtual extirpation
> of the white-tail's natural predators, has helped its population to
> explode.
>
> **Vocalization**: the white-tail has a repertoire of social grunts and
> wheezes, but reserves its loudest sounds for
>
> the mating season. During the rut, males will make a variety of
> grunts, wheezing snorts and groans to an- nounce their intentions,
> corral does, or warn rivals.

> all their roots, at least the long, deep, strong roots that hold the
> grasses in place against the winds. Instead, they now plowed the earth
> and selected what roots were allowed to grow. And all of this cost
> even more energy because to be without roots requires one to levitate
> in place, nothing but a fleeting shadow over the land, which has
> become but an abstraction, no longer real because it is just land.

> the people in the shelter, and has been turned against those outside
> the shelter. And so, with the extraction of roots
>
> comes the need to extract more and more energy.
>
> Energy has become visualized for me in the form of long trains of
> black tank cars and coal tenders mov- ing across the plains. When we
> lived in North Dako- ta, they were parked right next to the campus of
> the university where I taught, and I often wondered what would happen
> if the oil wagons exploded like they had done in Lac Megantique
> (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Lac-M%C3%A9gantic\_rail\_disaster) and
> right outside Casselton. Now that I live in Iowa, the same wagons
> rumble by our house about five times a week. Here, they are loaded
> with ethanol, not oil or coal, but the image of energy being
> transported to markets is the same. The Prairie-Plains are the heart
> that sends fuel to the out- liers. It is a restless procession of long
> trains, traveling through places that try to still be rooted, yet are
> more and more depopulated. People and grass have been up- rooted and
> swept away, and even those who have stayed
>
> behind need heavy machinery to anchor them down, now that the roots
> are mostly gone and the shelterbelts are disappearing.
>
> There are other ways that the energy flows, of course. Pipelines cross
> the Plains like a vast network of pulsating arteries. Not veins,
> however, as there is not much coming back. Invisible, those lines are
> connected to the new artificial roots of hydraulic fracturing. These
> roots fan out from wells, which draw different nutri- ents out of the
> Earth, nutrients for the industrialized society. However, just like
> the roots of water-hungry plants, these new kinds of roots are also
> thirsty. They are thirsty for poisonous nutrients---oil and gas---that
> they extract, but they also put poisons into the Earth. Toxic
> materials are mixed into the water that is used for fracturing the
> rocks, and fracturing wells are extremely thirsty. In 2016, a well in
> the Bakken oil field (https://
> en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakken\_Formation) required
>
> 5.5 million gallons of water, while one in the Permian basin used 11.2
> million gallons of water. In August of 2018, the Bakken had 12,571
> producing oil wells. Some of this "water", too, will flow back out.
> This is now called *produced water*, but it really has not much in
> common anymore with water. It is about twenty times saltier
>
> than ocean water, slightly radioactive, and highly tox- ic. Apart from
> its use in the artificial roots of hydraulic fracturing, it can not be
> allowed to ever come into con- tact with other roots. This brine needs
> to be disposed of, hopefully for ever, and it is usually injected back
> into the Earth. In the United States, about 180,000 Class II injection
> wells pump over 2 billion gallons of fluids into the Earth every day,
> most of them in the southern Plains. What happens when these fluids
> are not inject- ed deep enough or break free from their layers can be
> seen on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation
> [(h](http://www/)t[tp://www.](http://www/) fortpecktribes.org) in
> Montana. Here, an underground brine plume has been migrating slowly
> through water wells for the past 40 years, a legacy of injection
> practices in the 1970s. Slowly spreading toward Poplar and the
> Missouri River, the only solution for this catastrophe has been to try
> and pump it to the surface again, and then to inject it deeper.
>
> The pulse of this network has become constant beneath the soil, and in
> some places, it has become so strong that it regularly causes small
> earthquakes. Whether or not these pulses will eventually set the liq-
> uids free is a matter of debate that will only be shown by time. If,
> however, any of the produced waters make
>
> their way to the grass roots, people, plants, and animals will have to
> leave. Under the ground sleeps the greatest danger to communities. It

> long shelterbelts, a mile apart, over more than a thousand miles from
> North Da- kota to Texas. While this plan was eventually given up,
> between 1935 and 1942, the Forest Service planted 220 million trees in
