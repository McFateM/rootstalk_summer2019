Others are more clearly negative—<i>pollution, debt, cult</i>—or positive—<i>love, warmth, faith</i>. For me, the word community is in the “positive” category.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">I would rather not get into the definition game; books have been written about it. Maybe we can get away with saying, “you know community when you see it.” In any event, for most people, most of the time, community conjures thoughts and feelings that are good, supportive, comfortable. Those who find it suf- focating to live in places where the person next door knows too much about them will generally not com- plain about community; instead, their complaint will center on small towns, on nosy neighbors, or on not having enough to do. In fact, we often hear and read laments about the decline of community feeling in the contemporary world. Most of us think it’s good to live in a place that has a community feel about it, whether that place is an urban neighborhood, a rural church parish, or a village.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Rootstalk <a href="http://www.grinnell.edu/" class="s6" target="_blank">is a publication of Grinnell College’s Center for Prairie Studies (https://www.gr</a><span class="p">innell.edu/ academics/centers-programs/prairie-studies), whose three guiding principles—as it says on our letterhead— are </span>community, sustainability, and place<span class="p">. By definition then, we at </span>Rootstalk <span class="p">are interested in community—its meaning, its shape, and our ability to keep it healthy. What experiences create a feeling of community? What goals can bring a community together? What strains can divide a community? What role do memory and tradition play in maintaining a community?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">This issue of <i>Rootstalk </i>offers several pieces of con- tent that address such questions. The short essays by Bridget Brandt, Sam Cox, Randall Hotchkin, and Allan and Shirley Moyer in fact came out of a writing work- shop, centered on defining community, which we held last spring as part of a class at Grinnell College co-taught by <i>Rootstalk’s </i>editor, Mark Baechtel, and myself. The stu- dents in our class first took their own writing workshop, facilitated by noted northeast Iowa writer and publish- er, Robert Wolf (whose new book, <a href="http://www/" class="s4" target="_blank">Building the Agricul- tural City: A Handbook for Rural Renewal </a><a href="http://www/" class="s6" target="_blank">(http://www. robertwolfthewriter.com/books/building-the-agricul- tural-city), is reviewed in this issue by Fred Kirschen- mann). Bob, who has led writing workshops around the country, had each student share a personal story with the class. These oral stories became the basis for writing, as Bob coached each student in finding their voice and creating an engaging narrative structure. Next, we in- vited residents from the town of Grinnell (htt</a>ps://www. grinnelliowa.gov, where Grinnell College is located) to participate in the class for several sessions. Each com-</p><p class="s8" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">Publisher&#39;s note <span class="s9">| </span>Andelson</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">munity member was paired with a student, whose task it was to help them in the way Bob had helped the stu- dents. The stories that came out of these sessions pro- vide glimpses of the community feeling in Grinnell. We decided to include in this set a photo essay by one of the students in the class, Katie Hess, as it deals with an after-school arts program in Grinnell.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.atu.edu/" class="s6" target="_blank">There are other content-pieces in this issue which deal with community. An essay from Mary Kay Shan- ley (http://www.marykayshanley.com) explores the evolution of newspaper obituaries as an expression of community life. Joshua Lockyer (https://www.at</a><a href="http://www/" class="s6" target="_blank">u.edu/ profiles.php?name=jlockyer&amp;menu=behaviorsci) tells us about the Dancing Rabbit Ecovillage (htt</a>ps://www. dancingrabbit.org) in northeast Missouri—an inten- tionally-formed community whose residents are trans- forming a piece of former farmland into a space where they can collectively realize a new vision of society, in</p><p style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.dartanyan.com/" class="s6" target="_blank">the process finding ways to dramatically shrink their collective carbon footprint. An autobiographical essay from Dartanyan Brown (https://www.da</a>rtanyan.com/ About_Me.html) begins in the Mahaska County, Iowa, coal mining town of Buxton (https://en.wikipedia.org/ wiki/Buxton_Historic_Townsite), a racially integrated community where his grandmother was born. Her ex- perience there shaped Dartanyan’s sense of community throughout his life.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Not all of the content in the fall issue deals with community, but—as usual—all of it deals with life in the prairie region, which we like to think of as a wider com- munity of readers. We hope you enjoy everything in the issue, and we hope that what you see here provokes you to frame your own thoughts about what it means to live in concert with other humans. Let us hear from you.

This has been one of them.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">I&#39;m thinking about this phrase—particularly the <i>eight million stories </i>part—as I assemble the essays for this issue of <i>Rootstalk </i>which community members in Grinnell, Iowa, worked up with Jon Andelson, me and our students in the community writing workshop we convened last spring. Our workshop&#39;s participants in- cluded small-town politicians, a retired teacher, a social worker, a pair of retired farmers, a professional wood- worker, a coffee shop owner, and one of the town&#39;s bar- bers. While the stories they produced didn&#39;t quite add up to eight million, they were striking nonetheless for their variety, depth and poignancy. None of our work- shop participants were professional storytellers. And yet, by turns, they shared passages from their lives that were warm, funny, instructive, touching, and—to use a word that’s much-overused these days—<i>diverse</i>. I was surprised.</p><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">As I think of it now, though, I shouldn’t have been. Having grown up myself in a town with fewer people in it than Grinnell’s 10,000, I know better than to sell my neighbors short. I guess I’m as guilty as the next person of putting my head down and focusing only on the next step rather than the landscape that’s opening up around me.</p><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Sitting at the table with these people was not a little humbling. I&#39;d known some of these folks for years, and I figured I knew them pretty well—well enough, any- way, to call them <i>neighbors </i>if not <i>friends. </i>And yet, many times during our workshop, in response to something</p><p class="s8" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">Editor&#39;s note <span class="s9">| </span>Baechtel</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">one of the participants shared, I felt like saying: <i>I had no idea....</i></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">I daresay I&#39;m not alone in this. Most of us are in a great hurry to do what we need to do to live our lives. We don&#39;t talk to each other, or if we do, too often we don&#39;t really <i>listen </i>to each other, because (we tell our- selves) we don&#39;t have time. We&#39;ve got to get to work, got to fill our gas tank, got to pick up the kids from school, got to hustle home to fix dinner, got to tick off the myr- iad of items on our to-do list.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">That&#39;s just modern life, right? Fast-paced and all-consuming in all its particulars. Sitting and listening during this workshop, though, I was reminded that this ought not to be considered the natural order of things. I shouldn&#39;t assume I know everything that&#39;s important about <i>anyone, </i>not even my friends and neighbors<i>.</i></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Once in a while, if I&#39;m lucky, I receive a kick-in-the- pants reminder of this truth. If I remember to exercise good judgement, keep my ears open and pay attention, I am privileged to hear the sorts of stories my neigh- bors told on those afternoons we convened in Grinnell&#39;s</p><p style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Drake Community Library. In towns like Grinnell, across the prairie region and across the country, we too often pass each other by without sparing each other a glance. And yet—as our workshop experience showed me—if we slow down for an afternoon, or even for a minute, how much we have to say to each other!</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">In Whitman&#39;s &quot;Song of Myself,&quot; he told us: <i>I am large. I contain multitudes. </i>It is salutary to be reminded that this is true, not just for poets, but for all of us. I need to remember who’s selling me coffee, who’s cutting my hair, who’s teaching my children, who’s caring for my town’s afflicted, who’s growing my food, and making sure the police get paid and the water that flows from my tap is clean. The people who do all these jobs are “just” my neighbors, but their lives are as rich, compli- cated, intense and urgent—as big—as mine or anyone else’s, no matter the size of the town or the city or the acreage they call home.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">It’s quiet out here on the prairie, but that quiet is deceptive. <i>We are large. We contain multitudes.</i></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">P<span class="s11">hoto by </span>j<span class="s11">on </span>a<span class="s11">ndelson</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 283pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A Place to Call Home</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 283pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">by <span class="s1">b</span>rIdget <span class="s1">b</span>randt</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">P<span class="s11">hoto Courtesy oF </span>b<span class="s11">rIdget </span>b<span class="s11">randt</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s29" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Bridget Brandt <span class="s31">grew up and went to school in Mankato, Minnesota, and is a graduate of Mankato State Universi- ty (https://mankato.mnsu.edu).

A few weeks earlier, my husband had received a call to be the new pastor at Immanuel Lutheran Church, a small church north of the high school, with cornfields in its backyard. We knew little of Grinnell, only that it was sandwiched between Iowa City and Des Moines, it had a small, world-renowned liberal arts college located in it, and it was a half-day’s drive from Grandma’s and Grandpa’s house.</p><p style="padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">On our family’s second day in Grinnell we walked to the public library. This was something we did wher- ever we moved because we learned that you can tell a lot about a community by its library, especially considering what it offers children. As we drew closer, we could see some kind of activity on the front lawn. Old and young were at tables folding multi-colored paper squares into paper cranes. One thousand of them. I have always remembered the date: August 6, 1990, the 45th anni- versary of the bombing of Hiroshima. The staff at the library offered this activity in order to teach children about this tragic event in world history, but in a way that gave them hope. It became our first memory of liv- ing in Grinnell. After joining the activity and making our cranes, we walked into the beautiful library with its rich, warm wood and its smell of thousands of books.</p><p class="s8" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">A Place to Call Home <span class="s16">| </span>Brandt</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">We loved the glass floor in the upstairs stacks and the glass ceiling one saw looking up from below. Through the time to come, we would return again and again to enjoy this treasure in Grinnell.</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">As we settled into our new life , we slowly began</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Grinnell back home with them.</p><p style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">This past October my husband and I were in a small church in Cape Breton, in northern Nova Scotia, to at- tend a Celtic service called ‘The Blessing of the Kilts’. I</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">to discover had just signed</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">the things that made Grinnell seem a spe- cial place to us.

We started learning the stories of the peo- ple who live here, and they began to learn ours. We de- veloped friendships that would last a lifetime and that have made our lives so much richer and more joyful.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">For instance, there was the day when we were walk- ing to Merrill Park, just down the street from where we lived, and saw a little boy about four years old crouched down on the sidewalk with a bowl full of water. He looked to be about our son’s age, so we stopped to talk with him for a little while. When we asked him what he was doing, he responded, “Drowning ants.” Our son had just met the boy who would be his best friend grow- ing up. They bonded through riding bikes, playing base- ball, playing their instruments in marching band, run- ning cross country. Later, that boy was a groomsman in our son’s wedding. We still laugh remembering that day. No other place on earth has Hamburger Hill, which is the spot on the golf course where kids go sledding in Grinnell on sparkling white winter snow days, or Dari Barn, where chocolate ice cream in a cup with crunch makes any day in summer a holiday. Where else can you hear the sounds of a bagpipe band coming from the neighbor’s backyard, or attend world class music con- certs and sporting events at Grinnell College with no admission fee? And—maybe the best thing—students from around the world who teach us of the culture of their home country and, in return, take something of</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">“Are you from Grinnell, Iowa?” When I responded that yes, we were, she took my hand and said that her hus- band had graduated from Grinnell High School and Grinnell College and had just been in Grinnell the week before to attend the high school homecoming parade celebrating his 50th year class reunion.

Whispers of Grinnell seem to follow you wherever you go.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Our children have let us know that we can never move away from Grinnell, because they al- ways want to come back here.

To come back home.</p><p style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Last September our son came home to cele- brate his 40th birthday. When we asked him what he would like to do, he said he wanted to get his childhood buddies together and play Home Run Derby down at Merrill Park, where they had played so often when they were kids. We collected sever- al buckets of the baseballs we had carefully stored away in our basement, grabbed a few of the old baseball gloves, and headed to the park.

He was the middle child in a family of thirteen children. He grew up in the country and moved to Grinnell in 1944. He graduated from high school in 1948 and worked at Central Market cutting meat un- til he joined the Navy in 1951. In 1958, he married Pat Thigh, and they raised three children. His wife Pat passed away in 1973. Three years later, he met and married Shirley Selle in 1976. For a short time, he worked at Donaldson’s in Grinnell, but he’s farmed the majority of his life before retir- ing in 2016.</i></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 87pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">otrods.

I then moved to Grinnell with my folks. A second-hand bicycle was the incen- tive to attend high school. Before I ever got my license, I drove with my parents to “Seven Mile Corner,” and a patrolman came along and stopped us. He said I was a good driver, but I was too short and, of course, had no license. He gave me a five dollar fine, which my fa- ther paid. In 1945, five dollars was quite a bit of money! When I finally got my license, I was restricted to sitting on a pillow when I drove.</p><p style="padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">During high school, I bought a motorbike, which would reach upwards of 50 mph, but I didn’t get my first “hot car” until I graduated in 1948: a 1932 Model B Ford, black. I had to pay for the car myself. Once outta’ high school, I worked at Central Meat Market for $30 a week cutting meat, and that’s how I paid for it. The Ford had a V8 engine and spare wheels in each of the front fenders. At that time it was one of the fastest cars in Grinnell, and I thought it was real cool.</p><p style="padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Back then everybody would be downtown, just messing around. The girls would walk the block and the boys would “scoop the loop,” driving real slow to show off their cars. We used to race anyone we could those nights. This was after people got done with work, be- cause, you see, everybody worked back then. You’d see</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">somebody, pull up beside them and then ask if they’d wanna race. Chances were the other guy would be driv- ing the other way, and you’d just stop in the middle of the road and decide where you’d race to. Then, you’d go out to the edge of town, line up and take off, ending at Seven Mile Corner on the other edge of town. The Seven Mile Corner was the intersection of Highway 63 to Tama and Route Six to Malcom, a local landmark. The girls were young and silly and they’d always be two or three together. You’d always have buddies in the car with you. It was never a one-on-one thing. My friends would be rooting for me in the back of the car. We lost very few races in town.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: left;">Hot Hand</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">I think we only had around three or four police then. The chief at the time was Glen Bell. I knew two of the local police pretty well. They</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">racin’, they’d probably be in big trouble. All he knew was that I had the hottest car in town.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Unfortunately, “the hottest car in town” eventually came to an end. The car was light in the rear-end, which made it possible to slide it around corners fast without upsetting; however, the car had one big drawback: it was very hard on transmissions. You had to replace the transmissions at least half a dozen times, so it got to be almost second nature. Transmissions cost five dollars. That was a lot of money for back then, as I’ve already said. You’d have to go to the junkyard to get a replace- ment. It had to be a Ford transmission. Fortunately, the local junkyard kept me in good supply. A friend and I could change one out in two to three hours.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Old Sam Berman ran the junkyard. I knew him real well, and he’d chatter like a chipmunk, but he knew what I wanted when I came. He didn’t give me no dis-</p><p style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">count; just wanted his five dollars.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">drove Pontiacs and always rode two in a car around town. Once in a while they would even play “ditchum” with us, with them “chasing” us around, but more often than not, we would end up “losing” them. Caution, do not try this at home kids!</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">One officer lived two blocks down from me: he seemed big and intimidating back then. But he was about as close to being a buddy and as friendly as you could get, at least for a police officer. He knew what I did with my car. One time he caught me as I was racing my friend Jerry</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">The officer wouldn’t really say anything when I’d win. Makes sense, since if word got out they were</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">racin’, they’d probably be in big trouble. All he knew was that I had</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 22pt;text-align: left;">t<u>he hottest car in town. </u></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">He’d have probably let me have it on credit, though, if I asked. The junk- yard used to be over where the Fare- way food store is now, near a ware- house for Meadow Gold ice cream, where they loaded into and out of trucks. The junkyard would buy old cars, iron and metal scraps, even an- imal hides. Back then they moved it all by hand or with trucks; now they’ve got big cranes.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">After two years the front frame finally broke, and I had to junk my beloved car out. The body ended up in my brother-in-laws hog lot! Tru-</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">from this little hamburger joint, over where Lincoln Bank is now, and up Sixth Avenue. He caught me right about where the new library is. Jerry’s dad had just got a new Oldsmobile. And the cop teased, “You’ve got a pretty poor car to be racing that new Oldsmobile,” and I said, “Well, I bet I could take you!” And so we raced out to Seven Mile Corner. They couldn’t go all the way out of town, but they’d go out at least three-quarters of a mile out of town to Lang’s Dairy. Oh, I beat them a cou- pla times. The officer wouldn’t really say anything when I’d win. Makes sense, since if word got out they were</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">ly a sorry end to my first car.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">However, I didn’t lose my love for speed and dan- ger as I raced a stock car, over at the Newton [Iowa]race track for two seasons.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: left;">High Stakes</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Back in the day, we’d race out in Newton where they had a fifth-of-a-mile track. I raced my friend’s Chevy for him. It cost money to enter. They had prize money, and they charged people to come and watch. It used to be a pretty big deal; over a hundred people</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">would be in the bleachers on every Saturday night. We’d work on it all day Saturday and then that night go and race. We’d fixed it back up again Sunday so it’d run. Ed- die Anderson, who had a body shop in Grinnell, even raced in big time races like the one at the State Fair, with actual race cars. I never did win much, and I even rolled my car once, but it was a lotta fun back then and a lotta folks did it.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: left;">A Family Affair</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">My mom took my car to go visit a friend once. Since those ‘hot cars’ had manual brakes, you had to use your head and know what’s ahead of you. It didn’t have no hydraulic pressure, so it was almost as good as just</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">dragging your foot to stop. You’d burn rubber taking off, but you couldn’t really stop it. Well, she backed out of the driveway, and before she knew it she was halfway across the railroad tracks! She never asked to borrow my car again after that. The engine was also pretty loud. You’d take the muffler off and stick a straight pipe on it, but the cops didn’t like that<i>—</i>kinda like my pickup sounds now<i>—</i>I always talk about fixing it, but my wife likes the sound.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 26pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">My grandson used to pull up beside us sometimes in town and we’d race as best we could. I didn’t lose many of those either, even when I was racing him with my pickup. Fortunately, I don’t get it by the police at all now. Don’t think they ever got any trouble with me.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a <span style=" color: #231F20;">1932 m</span><span class="s35">odel  </span><span style=" color: #231F20;">b F</span><span class="s35">ord</span><span style=" color: #231F20;">. </span>P<span class="s11">hoto  Courtesy  oF </span>w<span class="s11">heels</span>a<span class="s11">ge</span>.<span class="s11">org  </span>(<span class="s11">httP</span>://<span class="s11">en</span>.<span class="s11">wheelsage</span>.<span class="s11">org</span>/<span class="s11">Ford</span>/<span class="s11">model</span>_<span class="s11">b</span>/31380/<span class="s11">PICtures</span>/213942)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 17pt;padding-left: 283pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 75%;text-align: left;">Pony Rides, Vice-Presi- dents and Weddings in the Rain: Welcoming the World to Our Farm</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: justify;">a<span class="s11">ll Photos Courtesy oF </span>a<span class="s11">llan and </span>s<span class="s11">hIrley </span>m<span class="s11">oyer</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s29" style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Shirley Moyer <i>was born in 1933 at home in Jasper County, Iowa. Her fa- ther lost his farm in the Great Depres- sion, after which she, her parents and her sister lived on rented farms and moved often, looking for a better farm. Her family farmed with horses. She graduated from Newburg High School in 1951 and married Wayne Selle in 1952. They worked his parents’ farm south of Grinnell and had four children, two of whom died around nine years of age from Cystic Fibrosis. Wayne died in 1972.

It was the beginning of years of fun.</p><p style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">At our farm, we milked cows, raised feeder pigs, and had beef cattle. Before the present ideas of “safe” food, we served milk straight from the big stainless steel cooler and deviled eggs from our hens.</p><p style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Gathering eggs was the kids’ favorite. We cau- tioned them not to reach under setting hens. One little boy stood too close to the nests and was pecked on his nose. He cried and cried, and he probably hates chick- ens now!</p><p style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Bottle feeding baby calves, goats or lambs was also a fun challenge for teachers and children. There were baby animals of every kind to hold: chicks, ducks, kit- tens and rabbits. With chicks hatching, there was shred- ded paper to jump and play in.</p><p style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 28pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: right;">Carrots or apples were offered as treats for the donkey, deer, and llama. We even had an unfriendly emu. Peacocks entertained with their large beautiful tails spread as they strutted about. There were quail too.</p><p style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Weiner roasts or snack lunches were enjoyed down in the timber, which was reached by hayride.

Ex- ploring crawdad mud volcanoes by the stream was especially fun. On one occasion in the tim-</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">ber, the neighbor’s bull had ap- peared on our side of the fence.

Children would not go</p><p style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: -30pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">play on the big hay bales for fear of missing their ride. Two geese roamed the barnyard. Two grand-</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">mothers brought their very little granddaughters to see the animals. They had known my husband for a long time, and they visited as we toured. One of the geese grabbed the littlest girl by the seat of her pants and would not let go! I was frantically trying to reassure her, while the adults were laughing and taking pictures of her. When we see them now, they all still laugh about the goose story.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 27pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Handicapped adults and children were also visi- tors to the farm. After visiting with the animals the chil- dren would often smile and try to talk to the delight of their teachers. Animals were good therapy, especially the ponies.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">mances by various music groups.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: right;">Before the holiday season, the Rev. David Brandt [see “A Place to Call Home,” by Bridget Brandt, also in this issue] approached us with the idea of a Christmas Service in the barn. We thought it was a great plan and moved forward removing all the kiddy things possible. We made a pen for lambs, a cage for a rooster and dis- guised a llama as a camel at the bottom of the ramp. Weather was good and a few heaters made it comfort- able. The rooster crowed repeatedly through it all, and that was what people remembered. We enjoyed this for three years, I believe, but the last year it was very cold and that cold put an end to a nice part of our memories. The wedding came about from a request from our granddaughter, who wanted a Western wedding in the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">k<span class="s11">Ittens In the </span>h<span class="s11">ay </span>m<span class="s11">ow</span></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">barn. Her fiance had friends in Missouri who brought their horses and camped in the timber. Their job was to park cars.The rehearsal dinner was a fancy chuckwagon dinner in the timber where the cowboys were camping. Everything went well, and the service was very nice. The large crowd sat across the haymow and our friends sang all the wedding music accompanied by guitars.The weather was perfect, but when they walked down the ramp from the barn a large black cloud was in the west. The wedding party rode on our hayrack pulled by our black Percheron horses to the American Legion Post building across Highway 146 [in Grinnell].</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">The bride’s parents and the cowboys rode horses and accompanied them.The local police stopped traffic at the corner for them to cross.The wedding party had a large umbrella, which they ended up needing because it rained and poured all along the way.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Thankfully, they were dry, but Allan and I were soaked. When we arrived at the Legion, the electrici- ty was off so we came home to get candles and leave the horses. A buffet meal was in full swing when we re- turned and eventually the electricity came back on. A memorable event to say the least!</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: left;">Finally, when Al Gore was a presidential hopeful,</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 146pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: right;">there was almost a visit to the farm. The whole family had background checks and the Secret Service arrived in black cars. We were all quite impressed. They checked everywhere for sniper hiding places, even the attic in the house. Un- fortunately, the final de- cision arrived when not enough telephone access could be available to ac- commodate their needs. A big adventure, anyway.</p><p style="padding-left: 150pt;text-indent: 34pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Occasionally we hear from a mom or dad who visited our place as a kindergartner, and they tell us about how</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">their kids also enjoyed a visit to the farm. Many friends, relatives, and neighbors made this all possible and are fondly remembered by all our family. We haven’t had school visits for many years now. Almost all the animals have been sold off, but there is still a donkey and a mule. They just seem a part of the place. And, of course there are always cats milling around and hens in the chicken coop out back.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">So many memories return when writing this story....</p><p class="s8" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 390pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A Child’s First Taste of Freedom <span class="s16">| </span>Cox</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 283pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 75%;text-align: left;">A Child’s First Taste of Freedom</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">P<span class="s11">hoto by </span>j<span class="s11">on </span>a<span class="s11">ndelson</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s29" style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Sam Cox <i>is the proprietor of the Saints Rest Coffee (https://www.saintsrestcof- fee.com), one of the fixtures of daily life in Grinnell, Iowa.

It was a beautiful and warm autumn day. The sun was shining, still high in the sky, leaves were on the ground and though the grass had lost some of its beautiful green luster, it seemed to us as if the sum- mer of 1978 was still going strong. We lived in an older neighborhood. A little one-block street that continued on the other side of the tracks and was bordered by the cemetery. A mix of ranch homes and two-stories; most of them older and in various states of age. A very quiet street that you didn’t turn down unless you lived on it.</p><p style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">On this day, as on so many others during my youth, Penny, my older sister, was my companion. We were going to go trick-or-treating, and we were teaming up with our cousins and rural country counterparts : Jim- my and Donnie. Jimmy and I are the same age, though I am the youngest of three siblings and Jimmy is the old- est of three siblings. Jimmy and I often played together in our early childhoods, and we attended our first day of kindergarten together. I’m sure the four of us were an interesting sight: two blonde-haired blue-eyed boys and two brown-haired blue-eyed girls.</p><p style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">I have no idea what our Halloween costumes were that year. As was true with most children in our small modest neighborhood, most often our costumes were homemade. My guess would be that we were a clown, or a hobo, or a politically incorrect Indian. All I know for sure is that our instructions were to stay together and be home by dark.</p><p style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">It took a community to keep kids safe back in the day. Everybody was so much more cohesive, or aware of our little world. We certainly followed instructions that evening, and stayed together, because little kids are pri-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">marily pack animals. I don’t think there was a lot of planning; clearly, we knew where the best candy was in town. We all knew where to go. It just comes from growing up in your neighborhood, just learning and being aware.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Can you imagine? There was no “don’t talk to strangers,” no “hold hands;” no cell phones, no hovering parents. We were free. I think that stays fresh in any person’s mind: the first time they get to venture out on their own. I’m  sure every child can remember their first outing without their parent, and the sense of freedom that came with it. I can remember that it was just very exciting;</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">something that has remained stamped in my</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">P<span class="s11">hoto  by  </span>I<span class="s11">ngo  </span>r<span class="s11">ICkmann  through </span>w<span class="s11">IkImedIa  </span>C<span class="s11">ommons  </span>(<span class="s11">httPs</span>://<span class="s11">Commons</span>.</p><p class="s11" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">wIkImedIa<span class="s10">.</span>org<span class="s10">/</span>wIkI<span class="s10">/F</span>Ile<span class="s10">:k</span>Inder<span class="s10">_</span>FeIern<span class="s10">_h</span>alloween<span class="s10">_-_2004.</span>jPg<span class="s10">)</span></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: left;">mind: my first opportunity to act like a young</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">adult. Our parents were trusting us to take care of our- selves.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">I still live in this picture-perfect little town, where I run the Saints Rest coffee shop, and today, I have kids that walk to the coffee shop for the first time by them- selves. Because I know the kid, I can ask their parents a week later, and they will be like, “Oh yeah, that was their first outing.” You know, if you’re that kid, you remember that. I don’t know how you wouldn’t remember that.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">I just talked to someone recently who said, “You have a very charming town,” though—if you’ve grown up here your whole life—I don’t think you necessarily see that. The picture is a bit more complicated than it seems to be on the surface—a fact that’s made clear by a recent movie, “Saints Rest.” The movie was made by an alumnus of the College here; it’s centered on my cof- fee shop, and it brings the sense of complication to the forefront. This is just a small town—kind of sheltered, which is why there’s a false feeling of safety. I’d say we’re slower, not only in pace, but just behind the times. Back then—I can tell you—my family was so far behind. I re- member getting television when everyone already had it.</p><p style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">So, anyway, there we were on the western-most street of town, running full-speed away from our little neighborhood, pillow cases in hand and gleeful deter-</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: left;">mination on our faces.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">We didn’t do anything naughty; naughty was five years off, when I’d TP houses, and do other nas- ty, naughty things. That night, we were really focused on candy. Who has time to dilly-dally when candy is all you really want? No, that night, as we ran down the street, it was candy, candy, candy.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">First, we headed north to the “rich” neighbor- hoods. Big fancy houses with beautifully manicured yards, nice sidewalks and porch lights that beckoned to us. These houses always had the best candy, sometimes even full-size bars! Not an apple in sight.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">There was only one guy that I can remember who decorated his house. His name was Jim Haines. He did a cemetery in his front yard, with smoke, and lights, and he dressed up—I want to say he was a werewolf, or something—he scared the crap out of us. We ran, screaming, and I don’t think I got any candy. Decorating back then clearly wasn’t as dominant as it is now. Not even close. I don’t have any memories of that; I barely have memories of Christmas lights, as a kid.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Anyway, after heading north, we would head east, then south and then back home. Funny that I don’t re- member coming home that night. I simply remember the leaving. But I do remember our pillow cases getting heavy. I remember a few bits and pieces; but nothing as clear to me as running away from our house and into the beautiful unknown.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 16pt;padding-left: 283pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 75%;text-align: left;">Healing the Smallest Casualty</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">P<span class="s11">hoto Courtesy oF </span>r<span class="s11">andall </span>h<span class="s11">otChkIn</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s29" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Randall Hotchkin <i>(https://www.face- book.com/RJsBarberShoppe) served as an Air Force Medic in Balad, Iraq from August 2004 to January 2005.

We were a large deployment group</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">from Wilford Hall Medical Center, Lackland Air Force Base, San Antonio, Texas. Many of us knew each other, but to say we were well acquainted would be a stretch. After all, Wilford Hall was the largest medical facility in the Air Force. The range of relationships prior to our deployment was all over the map, much like the range of backgrounds and hometowns that make up every mili- tary unit. We’d been trained and trained well, but would that be enough? How would we perform in a high tem- po mass casualty environment? It was August, 2004, and we were entering a war zone, specifically Operation Iraqi Freedom.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">We were assigned to the 332nd Expeditionary Medical Squadron located on Balad Air Base (https:// en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balad_Air_Base) forty miles north of Baghdad. We had every function of a civilian hospital including surgical capability, radiology, phar- macy, supply, logistics, and so on, all housed under rows of canvas tents connected by one long, main hallway. Each tent that extended perpendicularly from the hall- way housed a different section of the hospital. I was as- signed to the Medical/Surgical Ward, which was actual- ly housed in three of these tents.</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Iraq was very different from the small Iowa town where I was raised, right down to the very soil. Iowa is known for its fertile fields while the soil in Iraq more closely resembled baby powder with a slightly tan tint to it. In fact, everything in Iraq had a tan tint to it, the sand, the tents, our uniforms, everything. The lush green rows of crops that grow in my home state were nowhere to be seen there.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Throughout my training, I’d tried to prepare my- self for the wounded American and coalition forces that we might care for. What was surprising were the num- ber of civilian and quite possibly enemy combatants that we would be expected to treat. And it was these patients that we would see for much longer periods of time. Aeromedical evacuation or “aerovac” was so effi- cient that we rarely saw the same American casualties for more than a shift or two. More often than not we’d return for our next shift hoping to check on the status of a patient only to discover that they had been Aerovacc’d out to Germany or even stateside. It was one of these Iraqi patients who would steal our hearts and become a ray of light in the darkness.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">His name was Sajad, and he was already a resi- dent of the hospital when we arrived. We guessed he was somewhere around four years old, but no one knew for sure. An Army patrol had found him in a local vil- lage. His leg had been badly burned and had healed in a flexed position, making it impossible to straighten. No one knew how or when his injury had taken place, but what was certain was that this little guy would nev- er walk again without surgical intervention. Even with cultural and religious barriers, it was communicated to the boy’s family that our facility could help and they consented. He began a series of surgeries where the scar tissue that bound his leg was cut away and replaced with layers of skin from his little back. I’m not sure how many surgeries he had endured prior our arrival, but he had not yet walked.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">We all enjoyed caring for Sajad. When he was com- ing out of anesthesia following one of his procedures, we’d hold him until he awoke and was reacquainted with his surroundings. I doubt that I’d take to the diet most Iraqis live on, but I do believe Sajad was quite pleased with what he tasted of ours, especially candy. He would devour anything put in front of him, and there were plenty of care packages to share. I’m not sure I’d ever seen a belly swell like his did after one of his binge ses- sions. This, as you might expect, led to the least enjoy- able aspect of caring for Sajad, as he was still dependent on diapers. We finally had to hang a sign above his bed stating in large block letters, “PLEASE DO NOT FEED THE CHILD!!!”</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">After each surgical procedure, Sajad’s leg would be in a hard cast or some sort of splint to keep it im- mobilized. Walking with a bent leg was impossible, but teaching him to walk with straight, stiff leg was going to be a challenge. Someone found one of those round baby walkers with wheels that he could sit in and this worked amazingly well. Sajad was off and running. It meant he required much more supervision, but it was a joy to see a child play, especially in the environment we were sur- rounded by. We couldn’t help but wonder whether this was his first time experiencing this kind of freedom.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">We worked on weening him away from the walker. We would often stand him up and toss a soccer ball at him. Prompting him to kick it back. This was quite ef- fective at working on his balance and agility.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">I definitely knew that many of those I was serv- ing with were extremely fond of little Sajad. Who could blame them? He was as cute as could be. He smiled con- stantly and rarely fussed. One of the fondest memories I have was one of those moments when you hear a new word or words from a youngster, and know he or she understands the proper use of that vocabulary. Obvi- ously, there was a language barrier between us, but one day I was holding Sajad and out of nowhere he gave me a big hug, smiled and said “I love you.” My heart abso- lutely melted.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">We all wanted to see him progress, but I don’t think we correlated this with him leaving us. After all, he’d been with us for the majority of our deployment. It only seemed logical that we’d be able to keep him. Sajad’s family had only visited a few times in the more than two months he’d been with us. We often wondered if they’d abandoned him. I was so convinced of this, and was certainly so attached that I actually had my First Sergeant contact the U.S. Embassy on my behalf to look into my adopting Sajad. They made it clear that that scenario was not possible. I now believe that his family probably had transportation or financial obstacles that kept them away.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Our feelings for Sajad were never clearer than they were on the day we learned his family was picking him up. Word spread through the hospital like a wildfire. I rushed to his bed as soon as I heard. There was a group of around half-a-dozen medical personnel there, which</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">was about half-a-dozen more than were needed, but we all wanted to say goodbye. The mood that followed was worse than anything we’d experienced to date, and we’d experienced a lot. We’d set records for the number of casualties aerovac’d out of the area of operation, so you can imagine the level of carnage we’d been exposed to. Our affection for our little mascot was clear and became even clearer a few weeks later when Sajad returned for a follow-up. Again, the news flew through the facility, and again I raced to find him. When I located him, he was surrounded by staff members and of course, eat- ing. When our eyes met, he lit up and his big smile met mine.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">There’s one memory in particular that con- nects the life I led in Iraq with the life I am leading today in my home town. I was one of the high- er-ranking personnel in the hospital, and func- tioned as a shift super- visor. Those who worked for me had specific pa- tients to care for, and duties assigned to them. I had much more flexi- bility, which allowed me</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">ing it. He was sure a hit with everyone we encountered that afternoon. Smiling and greeting them all, bringing a smile to their faces as well. He certainly looked sharp with that new cut and it seemed he knew it as well.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">It’s interesting to note that, many years later, retired from the Air Force, I find myself back in my hometown, cutting hair in my own small-town barbershop. I had a friend once tell me that she thought it was really cool that I had joined the military like my father, and was now doing hair like my mother, who was a beautician. I’m fine with where things ended up. There aren’t many things you can do in life that give you immediate grati- fication from your work, but I have that privilege.</p><p style="padding-left: 146pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">There are probably many things that shape a man and who he will become. I like to think we had a variety of mis- sions while in Iraq but most important to me was the healing of hearts and minds. Hopefully, lit- tle Sajad will never don a suicide vest or detonate a vehicle born IED (Impro- vised Explosive Device). Hopefully, he shares his memories with friends</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">to spend more time with Sajad, and I’d often carry him with me as I made</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">P<span class="s11">hoto Courtesy oF </span>r<span class="s11">andall </span>h<span class="s11">otChkIn</span></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">and family of the nice Americans that made it possible for him to walk.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">my rounds. One day I noticed his hair was getting a lit- tle shaggy and decided a haircut was in order.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">As you might imagine, this mission had a high chance of failure. After all, no one can predict how a child will behave in a barber chair, and that’s without a language barrier. Sajad seemed to trust me. I guess we’d bonded pretty well by this point, but honestly, I’m sure he was ready for a change of scenery. So, I loaded him up in the Hummvee, buckled him in the passenger seat and we were off to the barbershop. I don’t remember now if he gave me much trouble in the barber chair, but I do remember holding him in my lap as the barber did his thing, and I remember working up quite a sweat do-</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">In a perfect world, I imagine him as a community or national leader, working to erase the hatred that seems so prevalent in his culture.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">These days I get to turn folks of all ages around to unveil their new haircut and see their initial response. Fortunately, that response is usually positive. Many times, the customer is a young boy who can’t hide the pride he feels in how he looks. Much like little Sajad on our barbershop adventure that sunny day in Iraq.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 283pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: left;">What Do You Think Community Is?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a<span class="s11">ll Photos Courtesy oF </span>k<span class="s11">aItIe </span>h<span class="s11">ess</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s29" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Kaitie Hess <i>is a fourth year student at Grinnell College studying anthropology with a concentration in global development studies.

The kids attending Studio 6 come from differ- ent backgrounds in the town, and adult artist/mentors guide them in working with one another to create piec-</p><p style="padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">es of art that reflect their cohesion as a classroom.</p><p style="padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">During the spring class I was involved in, the Stu- dio 6 kids worked on a myriad of art projects. Some- times they paved their own paths in personal, individ- ual projects; sometimes they worked together to create something great and grand. In response to this issue’s theme of community, I decided to explore how the chil- dren of the Studio 6 classroom could represent their own definition of community in a mural. I reached out to GAAC staff member/teachers Katie In and Alesia Lacina and told them I was interested in doing a proj- ect. They excitedly agreed to spearhead a mural project where Studio 6 students would create an image that re- flected what community meant to them. Within weeks, we created mural-esque scenes on the classroom walls, and unleashed the kids to create.</p><p style="padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">I went to two Studio 6 classes in which students produced two separate murals. Both had similar initial prompts, beginning with the depiction of large trees. Before we started the project, though, I talked with the students to help guide what this mural would look like.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">We prompted the students with questions like, “What do you think community is?”</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Interestingly, the two classes’ differing concept of community was reflected in their answers, discussions, and later in the murals they created. The first class’s dis- cussion emphasized sharing, peace, and caring for oth- ers. The second class’s mural centered on the kids’ ideas about who community members were, and explored the theme of working together. This group continually</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">mentioned firefighters, police officers, and the idea of working together to “make something.”</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Using images of the students’ work and quotes from their commentary on community as they worked, I’ve traced this project from its beginnings through the finished project.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 75pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“‘C<span class="s2">ommunIty</span>’ <span class="s2">means  workIng  together  to  make  somethIng</span>.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 86pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">“t<span class="s2">he  roots  In  the  mural  show  that  we  lIVe  together  and we  work  together</span>.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 115pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 197%;text-align: center;">“‘C<span class="s2">ommunIty</span>’ <span class="s2">makes  me  thInk  about  my  FamIly</span>.” “‘C<span class="s2">ommunIty</span>’ <span class="s2">Is  kIndness</span>.”</p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 38pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><span class="s1">“w</span>e haVe  an outer CommunIty<span class="p">—</span>sChool<span class="s1">, </span>the town<span class="s1">, </span>PeoPle <span class="s1">I  </span>see at  the suPermarket<span class="p">—</span>and an Inner CommunIty <span class="s1">[</span>the sPeaker hugs her FrIend<span class="s1">].”</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><span class="s1">“‘w</span>e  helP  eaCh  other  In  a  CommunIty<span class="s1">. ‘C</span>ommunIty<span class="s1">’ </span>Is  PeoPle<span class="p">—</span>FIreFIghters<span class="s1">, </span>PolICe  oFFICers<span class="s1">, </span>and  other  PeoPle  who  work  together  to  helP<span class="s1">.”</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">“I’<span class="s2">m makIng a raInbow beCause It makes me haPPy and CommunIty makes me haPPy</span>”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s1" style="padding-left: 115pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">“‘C<span class="s2">ommunIty</span>’ <span class="s2">Is  sPeCIal  beCause  It</span>’<span class="s2">s  my  home</span>.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 18pt;padding-left: 283pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 75%;text-align: left;">On the Changing Nature of the Obituary</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">P<span class="s11">hoto Courtesy oF </span>m<span class="s11">ary </span>k<span class="s11">ay </span>s<span class="s11">hanley</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s30" style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www/" style=" color: #414042; font-family:&quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; font-size: 12pt;" target="_blank">Mary Kay Shanley </a><a href="http://www/" class="s32" target="_blank">(http://ww</a>w. marykayshanley.com) began her career with the <span class="s31">Des Moines Reg- ister </span>(https://www.desmoinesregis- ter.com) back in the day when you rubbed shoulders with Pulitzer Prize winners.

I’ve never been much of a tee-shirt person myself, believing that one’s chest and back serve higher purposes than sending messages via a cotton sandwich board. Although, to be honest, I did buy myself a tee-shirt the first day of each of my 17 RAGBRAIs (https://ragbrai.com). They’ve become badges of accomplishment albeit a little ragged from the wear. Curiously, this particular tee-shirt I stumbled upon spoke to me in an ethereal manner. Connecting with whatever spirituality I harbor someplace or an- other within my being. A deeply personal spirituality that didn’t manifest itself until the kids left home and I finally had time to think. This tee-shirt’s message was simple:</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 122pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: left;">I INTEND TO LIVE FOREVER</p><p style="padding-left: 163pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: left;">so far, so good</p><p style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">I knew immediately and innately that I must own it. Machine wash, warm, inside out with like col- ors. Only non-chlorine bleach. Tumble dry medium. Do not iron. Do not dry clean.</p><p style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">By the time I had wandered into my 50s, the notion that I might live forever (and ever) had quiet- ly emerged from somewhere, taking on form and sub- stance. I acknowledged its quirky presence, neither discouraging such a possibility nor questioning why I might be the exception. Rather, I’ve always tended to- ward a come-what-may approach. If it works, fine. If not, okay. There are other paths all over the place, just waiting to be trod. Which paths we choose, which di- rection we go now, which direction we go later, blend</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">in to become our personal footprints in the sand. And while the elements—wind, rain, water, snow—soon- er or later erase physical footprints, the history of who we are, where we come from, what we accomplish and, ultimately, what we leave behind, melds into the uni- verse.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">For a very long while now, we humans have been packaging up our past, putting bits and pieces of our decades into sentences and paragraphs to become obituaries for the newspaper and the funeral home, for family, friends, and for posterity. Having the last word, so to speak. And for so many reasons, that is extremely important.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">The obituary dates back to the early 16th centu- ry, its journey to now riding a wave of rich history. An obit is not a biography; that’s an account of someone’s life and is written by another person. Nor is the obit- uary an autobiography; that’s an account of someone’s life written by the person who’s living it—obviously up to a certain point. Nor is it a memoir; that’s an historical account or biography one writes from personal knowl- edge or special sources. It tends more toward the sto-</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: left;">ry-telling vein.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Obituaries, gathered collectively and over time, embody our historical journey as a people, as well as our personal family history. From these “short stories” we can come to appreciate the roles generations have played in our past.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">The word “obituary” comes from the Latin obit, meaning death. Brief announcements of death were published in America as early as the 16th century. But not until the 19th century, and following a lead from the British, our obits became more detailed accounts, appearing with regularity in the press.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">At the time of the Civil War, obituaries for soldiers often included sentiment and religious overtones. This is also when embalming began to find favor because it meant bodies would arrive home intact. Toward the end of the century, “death journalism” emerged. Obituaries in both England and the United States focused on the graphic and often morbid details of the person’s death, a trend that continued into the 20th century. Theodore Roosevelt, president from 1901-1909, died in his sleep at age 60. His obituary in <i>The New York Times </i><span class="s30">(https://</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">P<span class="s11">hoto  by  </span>e<span class="s11">mIly  </span>m<span class="s11">amrak</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s30" style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">www.nytimes.com) <span class="p">led with an elaborate description of the blood clot that “detached itself from a vein and en- tered the lungs.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">For a short while, obituaries in verse form had their day in the sun. Consider “A Tribute to Guy Swain,” a Delaware, Ohio, man who fell to his death while try- ing to chase a raccoon from his tree one night:</p><p style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">A precious one is gone, A voice we loved is still,</p><p style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">A place is vacant in our home Which never can be filled.</p><p style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">O Guy, it seemed so bad, The way you had to go.</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">and mobile, you could stop worrying about getting axed by the managing editor and start writing real articles.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">The latest winds of change, as far as obituaries are concerned, have been fanned by Social Media’s pen- chant for putting everything on the table. Dubbed the “Personalized Obituary,” they’re now written by a family member, a friend or even the deceased person, obvious- ly ahead of time. Funeral homes, as well as the Internet, provide a plethora of information and assistance. To- day, factual information, as well as insights into the life of the deceased, have become the norm. Once written, obituaries are sent directly to the newspaper’s advertis- ing department for layout and design. Nobody proofs what you’ve written so no errors are corrected before press time. Hence, people: be meticulous with your sub-</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">It wasn’t until the latter part of the 20th century that obituaries be- gan to routinely recognize ordinary people as well as the aristocracy. I’m in the “ordinary” category, and probably most of you are as well. Because of this shift to us everyday people, anybody can die and the obit can appear in the newspaper.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Initially, these obituaries in- cluded a notice of death, an account</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">The latest winds of change, as far as obit- uaries are concerned, have been fanned by Social Media’s pen- chant for putting ev- erything on the table.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">missions.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Another change: When we “reg- ular folks” began writing our fam- ily obituaries, the first eight lines were often free-of-charge. That’s not the case anymore, so <i>caveat emptor. </i>Know cost-per-word for copy and cost-per-size of photo. The obituary has become a reliable source of in- come for newspapers.</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">That said, for some people, pay-</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">of the person’s life and information     <u>                                                        </u></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">about the upcoming funeral.

Funeral directors</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">ily member either submitted that information to the fu- neral home or filled out a form provided by the funeral home. This was then sent to the newspaper office where a professional journalist—almost always a cub report- er—wrote the obituary and a professional proofreader checked it for errors. In the <i>Des Moines Register’s </i>news- room, for example, this good-to-go copy then traveled to the composing room, then on to the pressroom. Mis- takes were almost non-existent.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">I launched my journalism career in 1965, at the <i>Register</i>. Back then, the only newspaper in the Unit- ed States with more Pulitzers was the <i>New York Times. </i>Heady stuff, but new hires were still newbies. Gals wrote weddings, engagements and club news; guys wrote weather, obits and entries from the police blotter. For about a year, actually. After that, if you were still upright</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">may suggest the family run only the Basic Death No- tice in the local newspaper. Then, the family may post a more comprehensive obituary on the funeral home’s website. Funeral homes generally pay to have their logo and website included with these obituaries, so the fami- ly may not incur any costs.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">With the increasing popularity of social media in the early 2000s, news organizations began selling obit- uaries to online sites such as legacy.com, the largest commercial provider of on-line memorials—probably in the universe, but I haven’t checked. Even if no fu- neral is looming large in your family’s near future, look at legacy’s homepage. It’s a mini-magazine of stuff to read: how to write an obituary that will preserve your loved one’s life in story—how to prepare for a tradition- al Muslim burial—an opportunity to search for obitu-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">aries by newspaper—remembering Andrew Wyeth on his 100th birthday. The offerings, like the Internet itself, are endless.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">In case you haven’t noticed, Social Media has also conditioned us to share information with complete strangers. Hence, sites like obitkit.com. Its creator Susan Soper says, “We’re more open and apt to have a sense of humor rather than denial about death. People want to celebrate someone for who they are, not for some cook- ie-cutter person.”</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www/" class="s6" target="_blank">And Social Media have conditioned us to laugh out loud.

Wilson of Sun Prai- rie, Wisconsin, died in June 2017. He’d already written his own obituary, obviously in first person. It was full of one-liners: “I crammed a four-year edu- cation into seven years.” And: “Morningside College <span style=" color: #414042;">(https:// www.morningside.edu) </span>is a Methodist school where I was</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;"><span style=" color: #414042;">pages/national/portraits/index.html) </span>from the <i>New York Times </i>emerged from superior reporting. Three days after the attack, a half-dozen <i>Times </i>reporters be- gan working from a stack of 100 missing person fliers collected from points around the World Trade Center site. They crafted profiles—stories containing short but signature details of the lives they strove to present. The portraits transcend race, class and gender lines, telling stories of the old and the young, praising their individ- uality while cutting through their differences to capture the poignancy of their shared similarity: life cut short in an American tragedy. Eventually, “Portraits” grew to more than 1,800 profiles.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Today, the obituary’s format is as loose or as tight as the family sees fit. Some obituaries still fit into the proper constraints of etiquette. Others wander outside those lines and, truth be told, can be downright enter-</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">forced to go to the chapel every week, take one religious course each semester for two years.

So, if you’re in the market for golf clubs, golf balls, general sporting equipment, random electronics, CDs, cassettes and LPs, you should wait an appropriate amount of time, and then get in touch with us.”</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">After Noah Sagan of Latrobe, Pennsylvania, died of a drug overdose, his mother was determined to pay</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">tribute to her son’s sarcastic humor thus: “He loved the Pittsburgh Penguins, playing videogames, our dog Liz- zy, and chicken. He hated lifting weights, but did it any- way, then had a cigarette.”</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Then there’s Bill Maurer’s obituary. Bill was man- aging editor of the <i>Des Moines Tribune </i>and co-manag- ing editor of the <i>Des Moines Register. </i>His 2011 obit was written by friend Michael Gartner who has been Page One Editor of the <i>Wall Street Journal </i><span style=" color: #414042;">(https://www.wsj. com) </span>and, later, editor and president of the <i>Des Moines Register. </i>Michael opened the obit thus: “Bill Maurer’s goal was to live to be 113. He didn’t make it.”</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Robin Kline of Des Moines, Iowa, a culinary pro- fessional, crafted her 95-year-old mother’s obituary. I’d never met her mother, but after reading the obit, I knew the woman by the passages:</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">death, the word was out on Facebook. “The first post I saw was, ‘Rest in Peace, J.T.’,” his mother, Ann Wheeler of South Carolina, recalls. “That post showed up on my Facebook page because I was Facebook friends with my son. But it wasn’t me who saw that post first.”</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">After seeing the numerous posts about his death, with people asking for more information about the ser- vice, two days later the family posted information about what had happened, followed with a post requesting photos for a video. The final post provided information about the visitation and funeral, including a request that people wear flannels to the service since J.T. grew up in Minnesota.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">“I do wish, now, that there would have been an obituary, too,” Ann says. “You want some of that tactile information to remain. But it just went so fast.”</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">“Irene grew up on the diversi- Two more points to consid-</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">fied family dairy farm, baking pies for threshing crews, gathering eggs from the hen house and every au- tumn helping butcher and process hogs and making gallons of apple butter for the family table.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">“In college she became skilled in the campus bakery, and fondly remembered making doughnuts for student breakfasts in the wee hours of the morning.”</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">“When she and her husband</p><ol id="l1"><li style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 22pt;text-align: left;"><p class="s33" style="display: inline;">eaders learn not only what a person did but also who the per- son was. Such informa- tion-based storytelling weaves a sense of the local public into our history.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">er. First, until recently, including cause-of-death was required for publication. Not so today, although I believe a solid argument for inclu- sion remains. For example, the 1997 obituary for Orville Marlow, from Perry, Iowa, listed cause of death as complications of Parkinson’s dis- ease. In fact, the funeral director’s wife had been passionate about including the information. Since Mr. Marlow had run a gas station</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">moved to Chicago, she enjoyed dis-    <u>                                                        </u></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">covering the adventures of the me-</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">during part of his career, she won-</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">dered about a possible link between</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">tropolis especially the many different ethnic neighbor- hoods and restaurants that offered new flavors, dishes and cuisine.”</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">“Later, she led a team of foods teachers, introduced international foods classes to students and broke with tradition by teaching boys’ food preparation classes”.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">With this approach, readers learn not only what a person did but also who the person was. Such informa- tion-based storytelling weaves a sense of the local pub- lic into our history.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">And recently, a friend shared that when her neph- ew, J. T. Sleyster, a college student in Wisconsin, died by suicide, there was no obituary. Within 12 hours of his</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">his work and Parkinson’s. She thought such information in his obituary might be useful for research purposes.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Back when Mr. Marlow had been diagnosed, his children asked the neurologist about hereditary factors with Parkinson’s. The doctor had thought that wasn’t likely. Some years after his death, though, the family learned that Mr. Marlow was likely part of a “cluster,” as three of his cousins had Parkinson’s as well. Recently, his son-in-law, a genealogist, found an obituary for Mr. Marlow’s half-brother, whom the family had never been aware of before. He, too, had died of Parkinson’s. Such historical knowledge for future generations is lost with- out including cause of death in an obituary.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Also to consider: Obituaries have the power to make public statements. In 2017, Ethan Sergei Neubau- er, 19, of Urbandale, Iowa, took his life after struggling with depression, anxiety, PTSD and survivor’s guilt re- lated to a tumultuous childhood in Russia. His (adopt- ed) mother who, years before, had worked for the As- sociated Press, wrote a powerful obituary detailing the journey of Sergei’s short life. He’d first met Mary and dad Larry Loss through Camp Hope when he visited Iowa as a youngster. The couple joyfully adopted him. Sergei thought Mary to be very tall and found Larry’s hair to be quite white, but they seemed nice, laughed a lot and had great dogs. Sergei played soccer, lifted weights, loved nature, graduated from high school, and was interested in psychology and social work. He was able to mask his own pain by keeping the focus on others as well. At the end of the obituary, Mary made a public plea for policymakers to recognize the toll of mental illness caused by legislative underfunding. The obit concluded with four messages to others who strug- gle with the disease:</p><ol id="l2"><li style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -12pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">If you need help, ask for it.</p></li><li style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -12pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Seek to build others up, not tear them down.</p></li><li style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -12pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;"><p style="display: inline;">Avoid drama.

It is comforting to know that, overall, life really is “so far, so good.” That said, let me note that I never want to hold the record for being the world’s oldest living person. According to the Ger- ontology Research Group <span style=" color: #414042;">(https://en.wikipedia.org/ wiki/Gerontology_Research_Group)</span>, right now that record belongs to Violet Brown, a 117-year-old Jamai- can woman. Nicknamed “Aunt V,” she and her husband</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">worked as cane farmers, and Violet credits that hard work during her younger years for her longevity. She was baptized 104 years ago, has a 97-year-old son and has been going to church for more than a century.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">“I feel good, I feel happy to be the oldest person (in the world),” Brown told the <i>Jamaica Observer </i>(http:// www.jamaicaobserver.com). “I did not feel I would be- come the oldest person; I feel I would pass long ago. Thank God for whatever He has given to me.”</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">In today’s sometimes contentious world, Violet’s positive comments are laced with grace and wisdom. And that’s enough for me.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 283pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Worthless Rocks</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">P<span class="s11">hoto Courtesy oF </span>j<span class="s11">ohn </span>w<span class="s11">hIttaker</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s29" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">John Whittaker <a href="http://www.grinnell.edu/ac-" class="s37" target="_blank">(https://www.grinnell. edu/user/whittake) has been teaching an- thropology (https://www.gr</a><a href="http://www/" class="s37" target="_blank">innell.edu/ac- ademics/majors-concentrations/anthro- pology) at Grinnell College (htt</a><span class="s31">ps://www. grinnell.edu) since 1984.

Flintknapping (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapping) allows us to recognize artifacts, interepret their past uses, and examine their place in the ancient world. Flintknapping also happens to be an enjoyable craft, prac- ticed by all our ancestors at one time or another.”</p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">by <span class="s1">j</span>ohn <span class="s1">C. w</span>hIttaker</p><p style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">I’m an archaeologist, so I get calls occasionally: someone has an artifact they want me to look at. Usu- ally it’s an ‘arrowhead’ they have just found, or a collec- tion made over the years or inherited from granddad. I don’t encourage people to collect artifacts without documenting location, because this removes them from the site and diminishes the chances that they can tell us anything about past people. Nevertheless, I try not to sound too self-righteous about archaeological ethics when I talk to a friendly member of the public. I always enjoy looking at someone’s artifacts, even if I secretly lament the loss of knowledge when objects are removed from their original contexts. I can usually make a friend and tell them something they find interesting. “See the beveled edge on this one? That means it was probably resharpened—some of these big arrowheads were actu- ally spear and knife points.” And so on.

When foundations were being dug for one of the downtown stores in Grin- nell in the late 1800s, pieces of mammoth tusk turned up. They were displayed in the college’s Parker Muse- um of Natural History, a rather fine small collection that was allowed to deteriorate through the 1950s and eventually bulldozed into the ruins when an unusually stupid administration tore down most of our attractive 19th Century buildings. Most such Pleistocene animals (not administrators, but such things as mammoths, camels, and giant ground sloths) lived before people populated North America, so properly speaking, they are not archaeology. But they are still interesting, and there is always the possibility that a mammoth might be late enough to have been the prey of a Clovis hunter 13,000 years ago, which would make it rare and import-</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">ant archaeology. However, a quick glance at the bones usually tells me that we have found the last resting place of Dobbins the forgotten workhorse or Daisy the elderly milk cow, disposed of in a pit in the pasture, forgotten by the generations after granddad.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">One morning as I arrived early at Grinnell College’s Goodnow Hall, where I have my office, a uniformed po- lice officer climbed out of his cruiser and accosted me on the steps.</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">“Are you Dr. Whittaker?”</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: right;">I felt the twinge we all do when confronting the legal authorities, but as far as I could remember I hadn’t done anything criminal, illegal, or even publicly embar- rassing in the last few weeks, so I admitted my identity. “Someone said you’re the archaeologist. A hunter</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">found some bones we would like you to look at.”</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Wow, my own episode of CSI Grinnell! Human identification isn’t my field, but there are indeed an- thropologists who specialize in forensic investigations, and I did have basic human skeletal training with one of them, long ago in my graduate student days. Inside my office we opened a box with the faint fragrance of decay to reveal a set of long narrow bones held together</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">by some remnants of flesh and sinew. I was only slightly sorry to be able to tell the officer immediately that this was not a human hand, but what was left of the upper paw of a large mammal. A quick visit to my drawers of animal specimens confirmed this: Dog. At least the police would not have to waste time searching a crime scene for the rest of the body.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Not long ago I was asked to look at another artifact collection. As usual, someone had called the depart- ment, where our administrative assistant passed her on to me. The woman seemed nice on the phone, and said she had a lot of ‘old Indian stuff ’. She lived on a local farm, but now had to sell the farm and move, and want- ed her finds properly cared for.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">I applauded the idea. Most artifact collections, without any specifics about where they were found, are largely useless except as teaching specimens. A collec-</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">stringy hair, dressed in a worn nightgown and puffing a cigarette—one of Iowa’s rural poor. Selma welcomed me through an entry that was cluttered with dog and cat bowls and muddy shoes, led me past a kitchen, and into the sitting room.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">“The kids are gone now,” she said, nodding at an age-graded series of fading high school photos. “Hope you’re not allergic to cats.”</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">As I sat on the hairy sofa and submitted my knuck- les to the bulldog’s tongue. I felt a certain kinship with Selma: the room was messy but clean, and she plainly suffered from the collecting bug. Stacks of magazines, a large hoard of Tupperware, a few too many pieces of furniture.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">My impressions of the room are vague because my attention was focused on the large coffee table, on which was spread her collection of “‘artifacts’.” My spirits sank.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">tion from one specific small area, In front of me, in tidy rows, was</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">however, could inform us about an important site that should be investigated or preserved, or might at least represent the range of different periods and people who had once occupied that lit- tle river valley.

And I speak as one who likes worthless rocks.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">These are the finds that try my soul. Selma had asked for my professional expertise, so I wouldn’t lie to her, but I didn’t think she was going to want to</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">served. I asked the caller what she had. “Oh, lots of arrowheads,</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">hear what I had to say. There were at least 200 little lumps of</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">all sorts of tools, some pottery.” This was encouraging. You never know what people may have found, and some very odd things get called artifacts, but who could fail to recognize arrowheads?</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">We made an appointment, and I drove several miles out of town, past grain elevators, through the cor- ridors of endless cornfields, over a shaky bridge crossing a small stream, to a run-down farm, far from anything. A crippled windmill swung in the breeze that whistled through gaps in the silos and shook the rotting shin- gles on a leaning barn. The house was shabby but I’ve seen worse. I was greeted at the door by a hideous but placid pit bull, who was pushed aside by an indifferent cat, followed by a run-down looking woman about my age. She introduced herself as Selma. A bit overweight,</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">limestone and misshapen bits of gravel. I took slight comfort when she said, drawing deeply on her cigarette and coughing a bit, “I haven’t been able to get out and find more since the cancer.”</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">I was sorry for her health problems, but I certain- ly did not regret the lack of more ‘artifacts.’ I spent a slow hour looking seriously at each miserable mineral, trying to be polite and encouraging, trying to educate a bit. Friendly Archaeologist: “Oh look, that’s a nice fossil, probably a bit of horn coral,” and “That one is a piece of granite brought down south by the glaciers, see how it’s polished on one side.”</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 30pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Selma picked up one of the rocks: “See how this fits my hand? Your thumb goes right here. I bet they used this for scraping hides.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">I restrained an eye-roll. They always say that. If a piece of rock fits the finder’s hand, however dull, or rag- ged, or irregular, or boring, or natural and untouched by human hands it may be, the would-be expert is con- vinced that they know how it was used. To be fair, some archaeological interpretations are not much more so- phisticated, though we DO usually know the difference between a rock and a tool. At some level, though, all artifacts take their glamour from this kind of thinking. Whether you are an academic like me or a farmer like Selma, understanding an arrowhead connects you in some way with that interesting, vaguely imagined an- cient life, when monsters such as mammoths ruled the earth, when humans fought for survival with their wits and simple tools. You would not believe what appears</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">on ebay as a ‘genuine Indian thus-and-so.,’ But that is another story.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Gritting my teeth, I worked my way across the ta- ble with Selma, one pebble at a time.</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Selma: “Here’s a really nice arrowhead.”</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Me (mentally pulling my hair): “Uh, well, actual- ly… I think it’s a bit of slate. That stuff sometimes breaks</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">with straight edges like that. It doesn’t really seem to have been worked on at all. But this one, this shiny stuff is chert, which is what the Indians did make tools out of. See how it fractures with a sharp edge….”</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">It was a long and dreary slog, and she just wouldn’t have any of it. I kept remembering the man who had approached me once with a “Neanderthal necklace”—a group of purely natural fossil bits—who left my office in a huff. Then there was the man who kept trying to pub- lish papers on his collection of obviously faked nine- teenth century “ancient carvings,” and maintains that the academics are suppressing his great find.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Finally I made my excuses to Selma:. “Gotta get back and get ready for classes. Thanks for showing me your stuff…”</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">We parted on good terms. Although we really didn’t do much for each other, I like to hope that I left her feeling that academics aren’t too stuck-up to talk to citizens, even if we must be kinda stupid.

Ostrom’s findings about the commons con- tradicted dominant Western ideologies articulated by Garrett Hardin (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gar- rett_Hardin) in his influential essay, “The Tragedy of the Commons” (1968).

These ‘Rabbits’, as they call themselves, are recre- ating the commons on the prairies and, in the process, building new identities and a new community for themselves. Their efforts stand in stark contrast to state- based and individualized, market-driven approaches to land management that have dominated the utilization of prairie ecosystems in the United States.</p><h2 style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: left;">The Commons</h2><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">In 2009, Elinor Ostrom (https://en.wikipedia.org/ wiki/Elinor_Ostrom) won the Nobel Prize in Econom- ic Sciences for the decades of work she spent demon- strating that groups of people around the world can and do sustainably manage natural resources by develop- ing and using their own de facto systems of rules and norms grounded in local cultural and ecological con- texts. Summarizing the findings of Ostrom and her col- leagues, David Bollier (http://www.bollier.org) states, “In a commons, the structural pressures to earn mon- ey are reduced and the incentives to take into account subtle, long-term factors are greater. As a social insti- tution, a commons is also more likely to care about the long-term sustainability of a resource than the market,</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">alone. Hardin’s parable suggested that, in the absence of the incentives of individualized private property or the sanctions of centralized government authorities, humans in communities are inherently selfish, short sighted, and incapable of using resources sustainably over the long term.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Hardin’s argument was a cogent and relatively re- cent manifestation of a longstanding line of thought regarding land management. Translated into policy, including the appropriation and enclosure of Native American prairie commons and the increasing scale, mechanization, and corporatization of Midwestern ag- riculture, this line of thought has led to a century and a half of private and government mismanagement of the prairies. Indeed, it has led to their near elimination and destruction as described in Connie Mutel’s masterful treatise on the prairies, <i>The Emerald Horizon: The His- tory of Nature in Iowa </i><a href="http://www.uipress.uiowa.edu/" class="s6" target="_blank">(https://www.ui</a>press.uiowa.edu/ books/9781587296321/the-emerald-horizon). Howev- er, the recent history of the prairies is not only one of destruction and mismanagement. In her book, Mutel also documents multiple public and private initiatives to preserve and restore the prairies, but none of them takes the form of the community-based commons ap- proach that characterizes Dancing Rabbit.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F<span class="s11">Igure  </span>1: d<span class="s11">anCIng  </span>r<span class="s11">abbIt  </span>e<span class="s11">CoVIllage  loCatIon  maP  In  northeastern  </span>m<span class="s11">IssourI</span>. m<span class="s11">aP  by  </span>Z<span class="s11">aCh  </span>r<span class="s11">ubIn</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: left;">In this article, I explore two decades of common</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">tributed to a report called “Ecovillag- es and Sustainable Communities” which was written by Robert and Di- ane Gilman for the charitable organi- zation Gaia Trust (https://gaia.org) in the early 1990s. In that report, the Gilmans defined an ecovillage as “A human scale, full-featured set- tlement in which human activities are harmlessly in- tegrated into the natural world in a way that is sup- portive of healthy human develop-</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">property management and community building on the</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Missouri prairie by the members of Dancing Rabbit. My aims here are twofold. First, I wish to show how a group of ecovillagers is demonstrating that effective commons management is possible today on at least a small por- tion of the North American prairie. Second, I wish to explore their efforts to simultaneously restore prairie ecosystems and develop productive human landscapes through cooperative stewardship of their collectively held acreage.</p><h2 style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: left;">Dancing Rabbit Ecovillage</h2><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Dancing Rabbit is an intentional community of approximately 60 people, founded in the mid-1990s in Scotland County, northeast Missouri. The nomencla- ture “ecovillage” is used by many contemporary inten- tional communities to define their collective identity and indicate their shared commitment to living in more ecologically sustainable ways. The term first appeared in the 1970s, but its popularization is most commonly at-</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">ment and can be successfully continued into the indef- inite future” (cited in Dawson 2006:13). This definition has since been revised and added to multiple times. On its website, the Global Ecovillage Network (https:// ecovillage.org), an organization that helps ecovillages around the world network with one another, states that “[a]n ecovillage is an intentional, traditional or urban community that is consciously designed through locally owned, participatory processes in all four dimensions of sustainability (social, culture, ecology, economy into a whole systems design) to regenerate its social and nat- ural environment.” In general, deliberate, collaborative, multi-dimensional approaches to living in more eco- logically sustainable manners are defining features of ecovillages, especially in more affluent countries of the world.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">From the beginning, the Rabbits adopted this mis- sion statement: “To create a society, the size of a small town or village, made up of individuals and commu- nities of various sizes and social structures, which al-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: right;">lows and encourages its members to live sustainably. To encourage this sustainable society to grow to have the size and recognition necessary to have an influence on the global community by example, education, and research”. The community includes the local ecosystem in its definition of the term ‘sustainable’. As the com- munity’s mission statement goes on to state, living sus- tainably involves living “in such a manner that, within the defined area, no resources are consumed faster than their natural replenishment, and the enclosed system can continue indefinitely without degradation of its in- ternal resource base or the standard of living of the peo- ple and the rest of the ecosystem within it.” Deliberately situating themselves relative to both the local and the global, both the human and the other-than-human, is a defining feature of these Rabbits’ commons endeavor. For the last decade, I have been part of a team of researchers that has been working with the Rabbits to help them assess their progress toward sustainable liv- ing. We have done this by measuring their consump- tion of resources and their experienced well-being, and comparing these measures with those of mainstream American society. Our results indicate that, in many</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">key areas, they are living on about 10 percent of the resources used by the average American, while main- taining about the same experienced quality of life [see Lockyer 2017 (https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index. php/JPE/article/view/20890/20480)] for a full analysis and interpretation of our results.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">As part of this work, I also turned my attention to the community’s land use and land management prac- tices, along with the ways in which the community is transforming its collectively held landscape. One of the community’s goals is to restore a parcel of degraded farmland as a functioning prairie ecosystem that is able to sustainably provide for many of their needs while also creating habitat for the many other-than-human prairie inhabitants that used to be so ubiquitous here. In this article, I make no attempt to quantitatively measure their progress either at providing for their own needs from their land or at restoring prairie ecosystems; rath- er, my aim is simply to describe their efforts to steward their land.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Dancing Rabbit’s approach to land management and intentional community-building is what Bollier and others call an act of “commoning”.

The whole community makes decisions and formulates rules concern- ing land use, including the long- term leasing of individual land parcels to individuals or small groups within the community for residences, businesses, and food production. As their web- site says: “The land trust model takes land out of the speculative market while still providing an ownership-like option for our members. Each individual or household can lease a small plot of land for a monthly fee. … Leaseholders do not own their land, but do own any improve- ments on their land, including any buildings, orchards, gar- dens, etc. These can be sold to another member if someone leaves the community or moves to a different leasehold. Since members can’t sell their land, there is no ability to speculate</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">the Rabbits are activating the power of social cooper- ation to build community, achieve goals, and manage resources. Dancing Rabbit’s commons system is man- ifested via a number of components. These include a community land trust model which replaces individ- ualized speculation on land for short term economic profit with collective stewardship of land for long term ecological sustainability. It also includes a community governance system where, through a variety of forums and processes of grassroots democracy, people work together to make decisions about and develop policies pertaining to use of the land they own together.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Dancing Rabbit’s land is collectively owned and managed through a 501(c)2 land trust and an associ- ated 501(c)3 research and education nonprofit. Both of these organizations are overseen by a board of directors (on which I serve), but the day-to-day management of land and community rests primarily with the Rabbits</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">and land can be a permanently affordable resource…” (Dancing Rabbit Ecovillage 2015).</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Further, each leasehold is designed and used ac- cording to a collaborative ecological design process: “Each new leasehold must go through a community ap- proval process. The community attempts to guide new members through an ecological design process to make sure they are taking into account both the needs of their household or garden and the effects it will have on their neighbors and our land. Our goal is to allow great flexibility for each member to realize their vision of a sustainable dwelling or garden while also fitting their goals into the larger design goals of the village.” (Danc- ing Rabbit Ecovillage 2015). The community balances many priorities in its approach to using and managing the landscape with long term, collective sustainability deliberately taking precedence over short-term, indi- vidualized profit.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">As the community’s population has grown, its gov- ernance system has evolved, from full group consen- sus decision making to a representative village council whose members render decisions and sometimes dele- gate deliberation to committees, which in turn report back to the council or community as a whole.

This is an ongoing process of learning, experimenting, and adjusting their practices to achieve desirable results relative to the Rab- bits’ overarching mission and goals: “to design a re- source-minimizing and community-promoting, pedes- trian-scaled village that minimizes our footprint on our land to leave space for agriculture and wildlife habitat.” (Dancing Rabbit Ecovillage 2018)</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">To balance community-building and the meeting of human needs with long-term sustainable land man- agement, Dancing Rabbit has adopted a number of ini- tiatives and areas of focus. These include dense urban design, agricultural production and development, and prairie ecosystem restoration and reforestation.</p><h2 style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: left;">Urban Development</h2><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">As Connie Mutel indicates in <i>The Emerald Hori- zon</i>, the parceling of prairie landscapes into individu- alized portions for agriculture and urban development has been a key driver of the prairie ecosystem destruc- tion. When Dancing Rabbit acquired its acreage in the</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">mid-1990s, the land was a post-industrial farmscape that had not been farmed for over ten years and includ- ed only a few buildings left over from previous decades of industrial farming.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">In order to allow the majority of the community’s land to heal, the Rabbits agreed to build their com- munity infrastructure on only a small portion of their land. Current urban development is contained within approximately twenty acres, with plans to expand to forty acres (see Figure 4). In the early years, the chal- lenge was simply to provide housing, but throughout Dancing Rabbit’s history, community members have paid attention not only to their physical footprint on their land, but also to the embedded energy contained in the building materials they use. In addition to having a small geographic footprint, houses are constructed us- ing a variety of natural and green building techniques, often incorporating locally available materials such as straw bales, clay, and reclaimed lumber. As a result, a dense cluster of eclectic buildings has grown up on the southeast corner of the land.</p><p style="padding-left: 103pt;text-indent: -72pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Through its land use planning and leaseholding process, the community contin- ues to update and revise policies regarding the use of space, includ- ing the placement of foot and cart paths (vehicles are kept on the village perimeter, except under exceptional circumstances, often involving construction), the orien- tation of buildings to roads and to each other, and the incorporation of green space into the urban area. The overall aim is to create a dense- ly populated urban village on one small corner of the acreage.</p><p style="padding-left: 103pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Planning for the development of a commons in a way that consid- ers the needs of both current and future residents is, as the commu- nity’s website indicates “[a]n ongo- ing challenge,” given “the tension</p><p style="padding-left: 103pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">between overarching design and</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: left;">F<span class="s11">Igure  </span>5: r<span class="s11">esIdentIal  buIldIng  named </span>“l<span class="s11">obelIa</span>” <span class="s11">at  </span>d<span class="s11">anCIng  </span>r<span class="s11">abbIt</span>.

It will be interesting to see how the Rabbits ad- dress this challenge as their community grows over coming years.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">F<span class="s11">Igure  </span>6: s<span class="s11">atellIte  Image  From  </span>2015 <span class="s11">showIng  </span>d<span class="s11">anCIng  </span>r<span class="s11">abbIt</span>’<span class="s11">s  Current  urban  area</span>.

In contrast, Ostrom and her col-</p><h2 style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: left;">Agricultural Development</h2><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: right;">As the Rabbits increasingly met their needs for shelter during the early years, many of them were able to turn their focus to producing food for themselves and their community. This has entailed rehabilitating land that, while fallow since 1987, was degraded by de- cades of industrial corn and hog farming. In addition to residential leaseholds, the community has garden lease- holds where people produce food for the households and the kitchen cooperatives they are part of, as well as commercial agricultural leaseholds where people produce food for sale to their fellow community mem- bers and residents of surrounding areas. Currently, the members of the village have designated fifty acres for food production, much of which is yet to be developed. Food produced using standard industrial methods employed on private property, but organized according</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">leagues have documented more sustainable land use practices and food production systems in many suc- cessful commons institutions. At Dancing Rabbit, ag- ricultural development proceeds according to models much more in the latter vein than in the former. The scale of production at Dancing Rabbit is smaller and more diverse, often integrating multiple species into a field and sometimes, as in the case of forest gardens, in- tegrating wild and domesticated species into the same plot. Permaculture, a design philosophy for human food production that is based on working with natural forces rather than against them, underlies many Rab- bits’ approach to food production. While such systems have the direct and immediate benefit of producing food for people, they are also designed with an eye to interconnections and indirect benefits such as fostering habitat for wildlife that may be hunted, and to restoring</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">F<span class="s11">Igure  </span>7: r<span class="s11">esIdentIal  garden  leasehold</span>, <span class="s11">sItuated  near  resIdenCe  at  </span>d<span class="s11">anCIng  </span>r<span class="s11">abbIt</span>.

Administered by the Farm Ser- vice Agency, CRP pays farmers and landowners to remove en- vironmentally sensitive tracts of land from agricultural produc- tion with the goals of improv- ing water quality, preventing soil erosion, and preventing the loss of wildlife habitat. Most of Dancing Rabbit’s efforts at prai- rie ecosystem restoration are undertaken on its CRP acreage. Thus, in addition to catego-</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">ries of land specifically set aside for urban development and ag- riculture, Dancing Rabbit has a category of land labelled ‘Pri- oritized for Ecosystem Health’. Land management which pri- oritizes ecosystem health is part of the community’s efforts to balance the needs of the human and other-than-human inhabi- tants of their land. According to the community’s website, “This</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: left;">soil fertility over the long-term.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">A small number of Rabbits incorporate rotation- al grazing into their approach to food production and land management. While many Rabbits choose to be vegan or vegetarian as part of their sustainable living philosophy, a number of them recognize that prairie ecosystems are particularly appropriate contexts for the production of animal protein. They deliberately use animal agriculture in an attempt to mimic the role of grazing herbivores such as bison in the Pre-Colombi- an prairies. It is here that the Rabbits’ approach to food production overlaps with their efforts at prairie ecosys- tem restoration.</p><h2 style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: left;">Prairie Ecosystem Restoration</h2><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Of Dancing Rabbit’s 280 total acres, 160 acres are managed through the federal government’s Conserva-</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">is the area in which we will encourage and assist in eco- system health, stability and resiliency. This area consists of all Dancing Rabbit property not… [designated for urban or agricultural development]. We expect to es- tablish native species, stabilize soil, encourage diversity and control invasive non-native species…. We’ve plant- ed native grasses on over 15 acres and have been main- taining them with regular prescribed burns, an essential part of the prairie’s life cycle. We hope to rebuild the diversity of plots by replanting patches of the few native wildflowers and grasses that can still be found in north- east Missouri. While we do not work directly on wild- life management of native animals, our land provides a sanctuary from the expanding farms, roads and towns elsewhere.” (Dancing Rabbit Ecovillage 2015)</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Dancing Rabbit members have undertaken to in- form themselves about their land’s history and the de- structive transformation of the North American prairies</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">in general. The community’s common library includes dozens of books focused on related subjects, and the community’s approach to healing the land is a frequent topic of conversation. During an interview with me as part of our research project, one community member described a meeting with a long-time local farmer who informed him that Dancing Rabbit’s land was “proba- bly the most over-grazed, over-farmed piece of land in the county.” For many decades, the land was used for industrial scale commodity food production, primarily for corn and hogs, which eliminated most natural com- ponents of the prairies and degraded the soil. Studies of attempts to allow prairies to recover from industrial farming show that prairies can be so degraded, they of- ten only further degenerate when left to the natural suc- cession process; prairies require human intervention for successful conservation and restoration (Mutel 2008). Dancing Rabbit therefore desires to actively steward the healing of the land rather than passively abandon it to natural processes of succession. While not all Rabbits agree on the best approach to doing this, the communi- ty’s land-use planning committee and Dancing Rabbit’s forums for collective governance provide</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: right;">venues for decision making about the com- munity’s continuously evolving approach to prairie stewardship and restoration, which at this writing includes in-progress resto- ration of over 15 acres of native grasslands. Another collective initiative under- taken by Rabbits, with the aim of restoring prairie ecosystem health and expanding native biodiversity, involves reforestation. Original prairies in this part of the coun- try included oak-dominated woodlands, especially along watercourses, where the effects of natural and man-made fire were minimized and where more moisture was available (Mutel 2008). These woodlands were cut back as industrial agricultural fields expanded, starting especially in the mid-twentieth century. Over the years, the Rabbits have planted over 15,000 individual</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: left;">using controlled burns and other methods.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">One Dancing Rabbit member who is heavily in- volved in the land use planning committee has estimat- ed that the community is gaining, on average, an acre of forest each year through the expansion of remnant woodlands and the maturation of tree plantings. This has resulted in some of Dancing Rabbit’s land falling out of eligibility for the Conservation Reserve Program, as forested land is not in a condition to go back into agricultural production.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">During my visit to Dancing Rabbit in the summer of 2018, it became clear that unprecedented drought conditions were driving decisions that would have un- foreseen impacts on the community’s efforts at prairie ecosystem restoration. In July 2018, the community granted a neighboring farmer’s request to use tractors to produce desperately needed hay for his cattle from the 160 acres of land which the community had allocat- ed to the Conservation Reserve Program. Some com- munity members were dubious about the impact this would have on their ecosystem restoration efforts, while others suggested that such haying might actually do a</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">trees of species native to the prairies while also removing invasive woody species by</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: left;">F<span class="s11">Igure </span>8: C<span class="s11">ommerCIal agrICultrual leasehold at </span>d<span class="s11">anCIng </span>r<span class="s11">abbIt wIth hooP house and VIneyards In the baCkground</span>.

In its almost twenty years of existence, Dancing Rabbit has made significant changes in the surrounding physi- cal landscape. Through cooperative and indi- vidual endeavor, a mostly uninhabited 280- acre tract of degraded farmland has become a patchwork of regenerating prairie ecosys- tems, a developing urban area, and a variety of edible landscapes. All of these changes have taken place as the community used a land trust model and grassroots democracy to manage its collective relationship with the landscape while conducting an experiment in common property stewardship.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">How successful has Dancing Rabbit been in its aims to transform its landscape</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">community’s infrequent controlled burns. Whatever the case, this recent development in the community’s relationship with its land drives home two points that I wish to make as I move toward my conclusions.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">The impacts of global climate change will undoubt- edly introduce unpredictable variables into efforts to restore prairie ecosystems, whether at Dancing Rabbit Ecovillage or elsewhere. Furthermore, while the Rabbits do their best to systematically monitor the outcomes of their landscape management endeavors, they are excep- tionally busy with making a living for themselves and would benefit from more involvement by qualified sci- entists who have expertise in these areas. Concurrently, scientists also stand to gain through analysis of what is a living experiment in land management and prairie eco- system restoration.</p><h2 style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: left;">Discussion</h2><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">During two centuries of Euro-American colo- nization, the prairies were largely destroyed through processes of agricultural and urban development. The community at Dancing Rabbit Ecovillage is trying to re- store a small portion of the prairies while also produc- ing food and developing an urban area on its parcel of degraded prairie farmland. The community’s practices of agricultural and urban development, quite different from those so predominantly employed elsewhere in</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">into a restored, diverse prairie ecosystem while also en- gaging in productive activities that met human needs? The current answer is almost certainly “only partially.” However, just as the destruction of the prairies was a long-term project, so will be their restoration. As a re- searcher and Dancing Rabbit board member with long- term familiarity with the community, I aim to help develop future collaborative research projects at the community. Such projects may include helping them to monitor ecological restoration—soil testing, grass, flower, &amp; tree species inventories, and wildlife monitor- ing, among other activities directly relevant to prairie ecosystem restoration. At the same time, we will con- tinue to monitor if and how the Rabbits are able to meet their needs from the land in sustainable ways that lessen their impact on ecosystems elsewhere.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">How much food, fuel, fiber, and building materials are they able to harvest from the land, while continuing their efforts toward prairie ecosystem restoration? Can the Rabbits find a sustainable balance between devel- opment for a growing community and ecological res- toration? Only time will tell, but I hope that ongoing research can lend a crucial hand in helping the com- munity achieve its goals and demonstrate that people in modern western societies can still find ways to cooper- atively and sustainably manage the commons.

Although Berry uses the term ‘local culture’ in this quotation, I think he is really talking about a ‘local commons’ such as the one Dancing Rabbit is creating.</p><p style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">The loss of local culture is, in part, a practi- cal loss and an economic one. For one thing, such a culture contains, and conveys to succeeding gen- erations, the history of the use of the place and the knowledge of how the place may be lived in and used. For another, the patterns of reminding im- plies affection for the place and respect for it, and so, finally, the local culture will carry the knowledge of how the place may be well and lovingly used, and also the implicit command to use it only well and lovingly. The only true and effective ‘operator’s</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">manual for spaceship earth’ is not a book that any human will ever write; it is hundreds of thousands of local cultures.</p><p style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: left;">Wendell Berry 1990: 166.</p><p style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Dancing Rabbit is only in the beginning stages of creating its local commons. The community’s acts of commoning involve developing knowledge, respect, and affection for its place and its landscape so that it may be lived in “well and lovingly used” across the gen- erations. Conducting research at Dancing Rabbit over the last ten years, I have seen this creation emerging in the way community members spend time deliberately observing, interacting with, learning from, and stew- arding both their landscape and their community. I see it in the fact that they often name their buildings after native prairie species that may disappear if their habitats are not restored. But perhaps the best measure of their success or failure in creating a local commons will only be revealed in the actions and choices of the younger generation currently being raised in this com- munity and on its common land.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">F<span class="s11">Igure  </span>10: d<span class="s11">anCIng  </span>r<span class="s11">abbIt  ChIldren</span>, <span class="s11">headed  For  the  swImmIng  Pond</span>.

I create small pieces and individual parts out of these papers, fabrics, and threads from society’s past treasures and assem- bling them together.

I know for a fact that Oska- loosa never had an art center before, ever in its history, which kind of surprised me. We opened up a brick and mortar space where we could offer classes and whatnot, and about a year and a half or almost two years ago this space was offered to us by Musco Lighting [a multinational com- pany headquartered in Oska- loosa; </a><span class="p">http://www.musco.com]. [Musco CEO] Joe Crookham knew that we needed a better lo-</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">have this kind of service available. They renovat- ed this building and donated all their labor and materials, and we opened a year ago last April. It’s just been a killer year. It’s been just amazing. I think people now can happen by us and kind of discover that we have an art center and find out what kinds of things the art center can offer the community. We have lots of classes and ac- tivities, and different events for everybody.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Matt: <span class="p">We have the gallery shows.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -36pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Sarah: <span class="p">Yeah, we have a gallery, classrooms, ceramics, and  printmaking.

We also put up a temporary wall where people can come and hang up their art for a night during “Open Wall/Open Stage” once a month. I think that it’s beneficial to get people to put their art in front of people, I think that’s a big step. We’re just super excited about the growth that’s taken place in the last year. Espe- cially with this sculpture tour that’s happening and the things the Art Center is doing, like our involvement with the city as we implement our public art plan.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -36pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Matt<i>: </i><span class="p">We’ve got the sculpture studio that we’re work- ing on getting open too.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -36pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Sarah: <span class="p">The art center is expanding, so we’ve been al- lowed use of another building down the street on A Avenue. That will be our sculpture annex. We’ll be teaching three dimensional classes there like metal fabrication, welding, I’m not sure if we’ll do any woodworking there because of the welding, you don’t want that fire hazard, but we might offer some wood classes, we’ll see. We’re hoping that we outgrow that space quick- ly and are able to offer glass blowing or move the ceramics classes that way. So more three di- mensional that way and two dimensional in this space.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: -67pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Matt<i>: </i><span class="p">One of the cool things with the art center and the sculpture annex is that people in the community will not only be able to learn how to do these things, but will then have a facility where they can do these things. It’s really hard to set up a studio your- self. You need equipment that costs a lot and takes up a lot of room. Having that space where people can have studio time and just come and create it will be pretty unique in Iowa. I don’t know if there is another sculpture community or sculp- ture studio in the whole state.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Sarah: <span class="p">So, that’s our trajectory. We have big plans. Probably bigger than we can chew off by ourselves, and we know that but I think the bigger we think and the bigger we dream, the bigger strides we make here in Oskaloosa.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Matt: <span class="p">I think the biggest thing we need right now is to increase our people-pow- er.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: left;">a <span class="s11">gallery  show  at  the  </span>o<span class="s11">skaloosa </span>a<span class="s11">rt  </span>C<span class="s11">enter  and  </span>s<span class="s11">tudIos</span>.

How are you connecting with local funding sources or how are you planning to implement it?</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -36pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Sarah: <span class="p">When we moved to Oskaloosa we noticed there was kind of an art void. Matt is looking at things from a bigger perspective, I don’t know, he’s got this huge dream for Oskaloosa. I’m talking huge, like this is going to be an art mecca some- day. What he did was he actually sat down and wrote a public art plan for the city’s use—but it didn’t go that way, so we’re holding on to it and using it ourselves.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -36pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Matt: <span class="p">There’s a lot of elements to it, and really, the sculpture tour is the first step in that. For the sculpture tour we were able to get seed money— grant money from the Golden Goose club here in town—which is a hundred women who put a hundred dollars down each quarter to fund a specific event.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -36pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Sarah: <span class="p">It’s just a grassroots group of women that just pull their money and then vote on where it goes in their community. For example, we got seed money for the sculpture tour, but the next time I think the police got new body cameras. They fund all types of stuff in Oskaloosa. I think it’s a unique group and it’s a really amazing funding source.</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -36pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Matt: <span class="p">Now, the impact on the community is huge. Peo- ple come to Oskaloosa now and go, wow, this is an art community because there’s art around.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">We call it the sculpture tour and it really does act like a tour. If someone were to go to each loca-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“a<span class="s35">nywhere but </span>h<span class="s35">ere</span>,” <span class="s35">by </span>n<span class="s35">athan </span>s.

Those are places that you wouldn’t go to if you didn’t know there was history there but you start to learn about the community that way. It really helps engage the community and visitors too. So that’s the first step.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sarah: <span class="p">Phase one!</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -36pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">Matt: <span class="p">Phase one. We’re looking at murals on buildings, also some street murals. There’s just a whole list</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">of stuff that we want to do, but you know, we’ve got to take it in steps and make sure our funding sources are secure for what we’re doing before we add something else to it.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -36pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Rootstalk: <span class="p">You mentioned there was an art void here. We’re curious—with the schools and the local education system here, how does this connect with education? Do you get any support from either high schools or middle schools, or Wil- liam Penn University (https://www.wmpenn. edu)? Have you been able to draw them in?</span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -36pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Matt: <span class="p">We’re trying to draw them in. With me teaching at the high school, I give additional credit for</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">going to art openings and participating in these things. There’s art in the classroom and then there’s art out in the community that’s happen- ing. We do stuff in the classroom and we learn, and that’s great, but then there’s this whole art world that we’re trying to create here and that we’re trying to bring to Oskaloosa. Having those experiences is different than sitting in the class- room. I grew up here and I loved art and I went to school for art, but I went to college having never been to an art gallery. It wasn’t available to me. So when I moved back here to teach, that was one of my goals—to make sure these kids can’t say they didn’t have that opportunity, so that the opportunity now exists.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“C<span class="s35">ultural </span>P<span class="s35">edestrIans</span>,” <span class="s35">by </span>s<span class="s35">ue </span>Q<span class="s35">uInlan</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">When we first changed out some of the sculptures we were in the square watching, and there were some people walking down the street and they stopped and were looking at all the sculptures and they were talking. I have no idea what they were saying, but that was a conversation that wouldn’t have happened otherwise. It sparked something. I don’t know if they liked it or disliked it, but that doesn’t really matter. The fact is that they were contemplat- ing something that they wouldn’t have contemplated before and so their world has expanded.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -36pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Rootstalk: <span class="p">We’re curious what each of your individual philosophies or approaches to art are both in your practice and in your work in the community?

We’d been in Clemson, South Carolina but we had a studio in Greenville, SC. Green- ville has done a whole re-development based on the arts. It’s been rated one of the most beautiful cities in the South, and it is beautiful. They’ve developed the riverfront with art studios. So there’s a hotel and restaurants up above, but it’s all studios along the river and it’s just beauti-</p><p style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">all this stuff and coming from an environment where there’s a good number of artists to a place where there really wasn’t.</p><p style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">There’s not that community here. That’s part of my vision, is that we keep building our facilities up so that artists are going to want to be here. I know when I graduated from college there was no way I could’ve set up a studio myself. You don’t have the resources to do that. But if you could come to Oskaloosa, and you’re a sculptor and there’s already a studio set up then you can</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">kind of integrate into that. This is a great place to get started. It’s fairly cheap to live here, you got a studio to work from, and then we’re starting to build that community.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -36pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Sarah: <span class="p">My perspective from the art center point of view was a little different. I work with a lot of youth, a lot of young kids. I think that’s going to help, you know not immediately, but it’s building a popu- lation that appreciates art, does art, and knows that it’s valuable in all sorts of ways, educational- ly or emotionally art is just a good thing. I don’t want to put down my town here—so be careful with what you write—but I know that Oskaloo- sa isn’t too educated on the arts. And I feel like</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">our focus on education and exposure is going to help. Especially this next generation that’s com- ing up. Maybe [art is] not going to be this for- eign thing. The longer we’re here, the more of an impact we’re going to have. This is a safe space.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -36pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Matt: <span class="p">I like to think we’ve given a home to a lot of kids where they can feel comfortable. There’s people, not just kids, that go through all kinds of things in their lives and sometimes the world is kind of cruel and not accepting of people who maybe are a little different.

There’s constant struggle there when I want to make big stuff but then I realize I’ve got to make smaller stuff and when I can put it on the wall that’s even better because people have</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">munity. So Matt’s passion for 3D or metal fabri- cation or any sort of sculpture really has fueled getting the art center going, this sculpture annex going, the sculpture tour, I mean all of it. I want to say we’ve all worked together to get this going and up off the ground but Matt’s really been the ignition point.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 45pt;text-indent: -36pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">Matt: <span class="p">Going forward, we want to start a residency pro- gram because we only can teach so many things</span></p><p style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">space on walls, to people who are</p><p style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">they don’t nec- essarily have space out in the three dimen- sional world.

I do metal fabrication sculpture work, I don’t do figurative bronze work. I wouldn’t have a clue. That’s something that I know people in the community identify with as sculpture, these fig- urative bronzes-realistic-type-things, that you make out of clay and then cast. We need to bring in an artist who does that, so that it’s something we can get started. Once people learn it then they can develop it here and we can keep bring- ing people back.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -36pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">Rootstalk: <span class="p">You mentioned that you’re from Oskaloosa originally....</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -36pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Sarah: <span class="p">I grew up in the Cedar Rapids area, actually.

The power kept getting shut off, Christ- mas presents were being donated to us, I mean it was really difficult with the kids, but at the same time we were doing, you know, what we were put on this earth to do, which is to make art and bring beauty into the world. So we had to make a tough choice then.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 113pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">So Matt came out one day and said his old high school art teacher was retiring and he asked if he should apply, and I was like, “I don’t want to move to Oskaloosa, but if you want to apply, it’s not like we would have to move there.” He applied, and then he got an in- terview. I was like, “just interview it’s not like you have to take the job.” But then he interviewed, and</p><p style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">well, really well.

Especially with our children. We want- ed to set a good example for them, that’s why we went and did art full time. We wanted to say, “look, you can follow your dreams, you can be who you want to be or who you’re made to be in this world,” but it wasn’t that easy.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -36pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Matt: <span class="p">You know, we’re artists. Artists need a commu- nity to work from and to work around other art- ists and creative people. It’s interesting because I always think of myself as an artist first and then I teach after that or I advocate for the arts or I do all these other things, but I’m always an artist first. And then I look at some of my artist friends who all they do is art, and I’ve never been able to just do art, I’ve always done these other things to try and build the arts, and I don’t know where</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">that comes from. I don’t know, it’s just part of how I operate, I guess. I guess it’s because when you realize that art is so great, you want to share that, you want to make sure that everyone un- derstands that, knows how wonderful it is. And when you look around and realize no one else is doing it or only a few people are doing it, you realize: if someone’s going do it, it’s going be me.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -36pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">Sarah: <span class="p">Right.

In addition to the brooding pouch it shares in common with other marsupials, it has 50 teeth—more than any other North Ameri- can land mammal—opposable, clawless thumbs on their rear limbs, and a naked, prehensile tail. The animal is thought to have evolved in South Ameri- ca, but migrated north during the Great American Interchange (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_ American_Interchange). Until recently, its range extended from Central America to the norther U.S., however climate change appears to be further extending its range into southern Canada.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">P<span class="s11">hoto Courtesy oF </span>k<span class="s11">en </span>s<span class="s11">aunders </span>II, <span class="s11">taken </span>n<span class="s11">oVember </span>28, 2008,</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">at <span class="s10">r</span>oCk <span class="s10">C</span>reek <span class="s10">l</span>ake <span class="s10">s</span>tate <span class="s10">P</span>ark In <span class="s10">j</span>asPer <span class="s10">C</span>ounty<span class="s10">, I</span>owa<span class="s10">.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Vocalization: <span class="p">The opossum has a voice appropriate to its retiring nature.

The town that grew up around the mine, Buxton<span class="s45">2 </span>(near present day Albia), was named eponymously for its manager, Ben C. Bux- ton. That was where my great-grandparents, Ross and Blanche Johnson, arrived from Virginia in 1895. Why did they travel so far?</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">To understand why my grandparents and other African Americans perceived Iowa as a place of refuge, we have to understand the conditions they endured in 1890’s Virginia. In the year 1894, African Americans were actually the majority of the population of Albemar- le County, Virginia. (The county was home to 606 free Blacks and 13,916 enslaved African Americans, com- pared to 12,103 Whites.) Of course, fear of that Black majority engendered the kinds of naked oppression you might expect from those dedicated to maintaining White supremacy by any means necessary. Segregation was the rule in every area of Charlottesville public life.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Ross Johnson, my great-grandfather was well aware of social, vocational and economic lines that could or could not be crossed. Even a casual review of</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">what my ancestors endured in Jim Crow Virginia serves to underline the hope and possibility that buoyed them on their journey out of the South. During the Civil War, Iowa had been on the Union side of things (thank good- ness!) and so this land was blessed with a somewhat more progressive, humanistic perspective than, say, Missouri or the states that had been in the Confedera- cy. So, Ross and Blanch Porter Johnson left Charlottes- ville in 1893 for coal mining work on the Iowa prairie. My grandmother, Lettie Porter Thompson, was born in Monroe County on November 19, 1896.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">As a child in Iowa, Lettie experienced a totally dif- ferent social matrix than the one she would’ve endured in Charlottesville. That is not to say her family mem- bers didn’t experience reduced opportunities because of their skin color, but life was materially better in Iowa if for no other reason than that they were able to take ad- vantage of social and educational opportunities denied them in the South.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">That my Grandmother could proudly say of her Iowa childhood: “we didn’t know nothin’ ‘bout no seg- regation!” meant that something very significant had occurred. With a gleam in her eye that was still there in her 80s, she told me, “The happiest time was getting out for recess because you could play with ALL the children on the playground.”</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 27pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Over the years, my grandmother described Bux- ton as generally a very good place to grow up. “I don’t like this one, I don’t like that one…can’t go here, can’t</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">b<span class="s11">uxton</span>, I<span class="s11">owa</span>, <span class="s11">as  It  was  at  the  turn  oF  the  </span>19<span class="s11">th  and  </span>20<span class="s11">th  </span>C<span class="s11">enturIes</span>.

Perhaps the most important thing was that you could get along with people, and ba- sic respect was accorded to just about everyone—unless you couldn’t handle your liquor.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Her biggest regret was leaving high school before graduation. Work- ing to help support the family was necessary, though, and so while her two sisters, Katherine and Anzul, were able to finish high school (Katherine was a state debate cham- pion in the late 30s), Let- tie, also a fine musician, sacrificed her potential opportunities for the sake of others in the family.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">The grace with which Lettie Thompson lived her life was a model for folks both Black and White. As I mentioned, she wouldn’t allow talk about racial dis- harmony, and she instilled high standards in her fam- ily in terms of education, personal behavior and vo- cational excellence. .</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">cial circle of mainly women whose families had roots in Buxton/Monroe County. In the summer of 2018, I was happy to find out that the Buxton Club still sustains the memory of the place. It’s amazing that over a cen- tury later, the memories of Buxton still have a powerful</p><p style="padding-left: 151pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">impact on those whose predecessors directly experienced it. Without question, these are the cornerstones of My Inte- grated Life.</p><p style="padding-left: 151pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">My maternal fami- ly’s experience in Buxton was key to establishing sympathetic, forthright relationships with peo- ple regardless of eth- nic or racial difference. My parents’ expansive worldview and pursuit of knowledge across disciplines was pivotal in shaping my view of music, education, tech- nology and culture. It is the matrix from which springs the experiences I write about here.</p><h3 style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 151pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: justify;">My Parents Meet</h3><p style="padding-left: 175pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">My father, Philadel-</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Getting along with people of any ethnici- ty was the hallmark of</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">d<span class="s11">artanyan</span>’<span class="s11">s   grandmother</span>, l<span class="s11">ettIe  </span>P<span class="s11">orter </span>t<span class="s11">homPson</span></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">phia-born Ellsworth T. Brown, met my mother, Mary Alice Thompson,</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">my grandmother’s philosophy of life. She lived it and</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">wouldn’t tolerate any derogatory talk about anyone. When I was a youngster, my parents would go for drives, visiting friends both Black and White in little commu- nities outside of Des Moines. Mom and Dad would pack my two brothers (Kevan and Don) and me into dad’s beloved ’55 Dodge and head off to Albia, Marshalltown, Perry or somewhere else where the family had friends from the Buxton days.</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: left;">I remember hearing about The Buxton Club<span class="s46">3</span>, a so-</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">in Los Angeles after the Second World War. Mom was studying music at Los Angeles City College and working as an extruder at Lockheed Aircraft when dad returned stateside after his wartime duties in the Merchant Ma- rine. They got married in early 1949. A few months be- fore I was due to be born, Mom decided that she wanted to be near her family. Ellsworth and Mary left L.A. and moved back to Iowa—just in time for me to arrive in October of 1949 at Mercy Hospital.</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: left;">We lived at 1434 Walker Street on Des Moines’</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">east side. It was integrated like Buxton was, and we had lots of Jewish, African-American, Latino and Europe- an-American neighbors.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">In the mid-50s the Walker Street house was a hub for rehearsals, jam sessions, and music lessons for stu- dents like 16-year-old Frank Perowsky<span class="s46">4 </span>who left Des Moines to forge an incredible career as an arranger, in- strumentalist, studio musician and recording artist in New York City. Dad even had a system you could use to press your own recordings<span class="s46">5 </span>from blank vinyl discs. (Don’t ask me how that worked!!)</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Ernest “Speck” Redd<span class="s45">6</span>—originally from Hanni- bal, Missouri—while certainly not the only good piano player, was the most respected African American jazz piano player of the 50s and 60s in Des Moines. Because he lived three blocks down Walker Street from us, there were frequent music sessions involving him and my fa- ther. Charlie Parker<span class="s45">7 </span>was the reigning king of Jazz at that time, and I remember spirited discussions between the musicians about how to interpret Bird’s musical in- novations. Speck was posthumously inducted into the Des Moines Community Jazz Center (CJC) Jazz Hall of Fame<span class="s45">8 </span>in 2005. My dad’s induction came in 2010.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: right;">Dad was a bebopper (bebop<span class="s45">9 </span>being a kind of jazz introduced during the 1940s by innovators like Charlie Parker); Mom loved Rhumba, Merengue, and Europe- an Classical music of all kinds. I was im- mersed in these sounds, almost inundat- ed with them, from the time I was born. I would sing (Mom would call it yowling) along with records—no matter what style.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Though my parents later divorced and for a time my father drifted out of my life, this was a time when I gained my ba- sic appreciation for ALL music dedicated to telling stories and bringing healing to our beleaguered souls.</p><h3 style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: left;">My early exposure to technology</h3><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">The Merriam-Webster dictionary de- fines the word integration as “incorporat-</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">has a significant, though different, meaning in the world of mathematics.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">My father was familiar with both the social and the mathematical contexts for integration. Ellsworth had been one of the few Black radio officers in the Merchant Marine during WWII. Dad integrated his aptitude for mathematics into his love of music, and this led him to the Schillinger System of Musical Composition<span class="s45">10</span>. Years later, at my father’s induction into the Iowa Jazz Hall of Fame, I learned from his friends in attendance that he brought musicians to our Walker Street house to teach them the Schillinger System.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Music, mathematics and technology were com- pletely integrated in my father’s mind. In my 20s, when I encountered the writings of R. Buckminster Fuller<span class="s45">11</span>, I found someone who could clearly articulate complicat- ed ideas in the same way my father could. Bucky’s <i>Op- erating Manual for Spaceship Earth</i><span class="s45">12 </span>was an inspiration, and it remains an inspiration to this day.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Dad also collected radios, and the pieces in his collection were objects of fascination for me. I re- member a small room in our house that was filled with scopes and electronic parts. As a youngster</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">ing or coordinating separate elements as equals into a social environment.” It also</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">d<span class="s11">artanyan</span>’<span class="s11">s   musICal  Parents</span>, e<span class="s11">llsworth  and  </span>m<span class="s11">ary </span>a<span class="s11">lICe</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">watching television (we baby boomers were the first TV generation) I was awed by science fiction serials of the day (Captain Video<span class="s45">13 </span>anyone?). The radios on Dad’s worktable had these things called “tubes” inside, and to me they looked like little spaceships. I delighted in re- moving them from the back of old radios and zooming them around the room flying my mission to Mars.</p><h3 style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: left;">The 60s: Music, and <i>The Register</i></h3><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">According to my grandmother and everyone else I knew, if there was something I wanted to do, I had to get out there, prepare myself and go for it. During the tumultuous years of the 1960s, I would find myself pursuing ambitions in two realms: the literary and the musical.</p><p style="padding-left: 115pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: center;">As  a  child  in   1954-56,</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: right;">with our neighbor Speck Redd while he was still in mid- dle school. By 1964, he had added the “gospel” of Little Richard to his repertoire, and became Des Moines’ first Beatles-era “rock star”. His musical talent was matched by a dangerously sexy rock star attitude that Jagger himself might have envied. An African-American with a Beatle haircut (!) and an instinct for knowing where the music of our generation was heading, George intro- duced me to memorable jazz and rock music experienc- es long before I considered actually performing myself. He introduced me to a local Jazz Festival at the First Unitarian Church and took me to the KRNT Theater to see Illinois Speed Press<span class="s45">14</span><span class="s48"> </span>and Chicago Transit Authority (later Chicago<span class="s45">15</span>), as well as Veterans Auditorium to hear Cream<span class="s45">16</span><span class="s48"> </span>(god, Eric Clapton played LOUD!!).

At age 12, I decided I wanted to be a writer.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">In a similar way, my childhood experience grow- ing up in a hub of the musical community primed me also for a passionate, lifelong ob- session with music.

He introduced 17-year- old Buzz Feiten on guitar to us. Also on board were Phillip</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">sonally. It is yet another example of integration as my life’s theme.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">In 1964, my best friend George T. Clinton (whom we called “G.T.”) played the Hammond B3 organ in a band called The Upsetters. It included drummer Jimmy Brown, guitarist Bernie Fogel and bassist Wally Acker- son. I blame these guys for destroying what was left of my resistance to making music a participation sport. George lived in what was called the “Southeast Bot- toms” or Chesterfield district of Des Moines. Raised in the Shiloh Baptist Church, G.T. was steeped in Gospel and Praise music, but he also studied jazz extensively</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Wilson on drums, Tenor saxophone player/vocalist and</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">songwriter Brother Gene Dinwiddie, and I think David Sanborn was in there, too, on alto saxophone.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 26pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">I had never heard of this band before, but after the concert I went out and bought their new album (“The Resurrection of Pigboy Crabshaw<span class="s45">18</span>”) and lost the rest of my mind while playing it.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Everything about this music confirmed that some- thing big was missing from my own life. My mother and father had divorced sometime in the 1961 through 1963 period. I’m not sure when, exactly, because between the ages of 11-13, memories of my father seemed to</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">just gradually fade away. My brothers and I were used to him going to out of town engagements, but as I got into middle school I realized that he was just…gone. I must’ve eventually been told the who/what/why/when and how of the situation but that didn’t soften the emo- tional upset.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">The songs, the lyrics, the sound…everything about the music I began listening to after the Paul Butterfield concert seemed to beckon me back home. There was something so inherently comforting and challenging at the same time that something</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">inside of me literally cracked open, I suppose. What was revealed was a yawning cav- ern of stuffed pain, question- ing and longing to under- stand what, besides my dad, happened to be missing from my life.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">I struggled to deal with feelings that had nothing to do with striving, with achieving, or with caring about social position. I dis- covered the primal longing that each of us is subject to as human beings. It was the simple realization that my family  had  fractured and  I had tried to act as if nothing was wrong in the years since the divorce. My brothers and I were trained to keep mov-</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">I feel it important here to mention that Blues mu- sic—that quintessential African-American music form native to the USA—was being ignored by almost every- one in 1960. By 1964, though, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, The Kinks, Fleetwood Mac and other British rock stars revealed that the secret of their success was the Blues elements they cribbed from Americans like</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">B.B. King, Muddy Waters, Elmore James, Little Rich- ard, Sonny Boy Williamson, Gatemouth Brown and, of course, Mr. Crossroads himself, Robert Johnson. It</p><p style="padding-left: 129pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">was deeply ironic: White kids all over America were losing their minds over British mu- sicians who credited, praised and emulated the Black orig- inators of the music. I believe the homage musicians like Mick Jagger, Paul McCartney and others paid to their Black mentors added momentum to an American Civil Rights movement that sought to re- store humanity and dignity (and commercial success) to many of those same individ- uals.</p><p style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 129pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">The summer before my senior year, I scored my first job, sweeping up the floors at Kassar Drug Store on Locust Avenue. It was, as advertised, a pretty menial gig, and while</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">ing forward and not to talk, think about, or acknowledge the chaos that enveloped our lives in the years 1960-70.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">a <span class="s11">PortraIt  oF  the  artIst  as  a  young  journalIst</span>. d<span class="s11">ar</span>-</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">tanyan  at  the  oFFICes  oF  the  <span class="s10">d</span>rake <span class="s10">t</span>Imes  <span class="s10">d</span>elPhIC</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">I was sweeping there was lots of time to think about what I really wanted to do with my life.

I was really glad I learned to play the blues on bass and guitar, because I was ready to fit right in to the Blues Revival that followed in the wake of the British Invasion<span class="s45">19</span>.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">nalism classes at North High School with Mr. Barnett, and I was already Sports Editor for the <i>North High Ora- cle</i>. Importantly, I had also written some articles for the <i>Iowa Bystander</i><span class="s45">20</span>, the state’s most established newspaper for the African American community. <i>Bystander </i>editor Allen Ashby was my first mentor. He was a wise, knowl- edgeable man who prepared me well to go forward.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">So during the late summer 1967, as I was slinging the broom at Kassar’s, I thought that my experience might enable me to at least try to get a job at the <i>Des Moines Register. </i>I just remember thinking: “This is it. Go and at least ask about a job.”</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">I put the broom aside, checked out, and walked the four blocks to the <i>Register &amp; Tribune </i>building. Once inside, I asked the receptionist where to apply for a job and she told me Fourth floor (while looking at me like she was thinking: “Sure kid, go on up…fat chance though…”)</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Thanking her, I turned and walked through the lobby toward the elevators, noticing the huge, slowly rotating globe that displayed the time in every coun- try. I also looked up to see the big, mounted panels</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">over and took my application and asked me why I want- ed to do this job, and what made me think I could.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">I surprised myself with an almost immediate an- swer: I already was writing for my school newspaper, I really, really wanted to be a reporter, and I’d do anything to begin working there.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: right;">He took his pipe and switched it from one side of his mouth to the other, evidently curious. “Come back tomorrow,” he said, “And we’ll start you on the phones.” Stunned, I stood there as it sunk in, thinking:</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">Wait…he said…come back tomorrow…that means… I got the job!!</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">That moment validated everything I had ever been told by my family about the way opportunity would be open to you if you were prepared. The civil rights</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">displaying Pulitzer Prize era was right on top</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">winning stories, editorial cartoons and headlines. At that point in history, the <i>Register and Tribune </i>newspapers WERE the news sources all Iowa (and most of the Mid-</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 22pt;text-align: left;">Integration is a part of this time in my life: when I was hired as a coffee boy, sports phone desk person and copy run- ner, I was the only African American on the <i>Register </i>editorial staff.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">of us then, and this gave me a certain amount of courage, I suppose, to go after what I really wanted. As I see it, moments like this one—where</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">west) depended upon.         <u>                                                                                                </u></p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">I got off the elevator,</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">courage is what’s re-</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">quired, if we are go-</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: right;">turned left twice and walked into a beehive convention in which activity was going off in all directions at once. I had happened to arrive just at Saturday afternoon’s sports deadline, where—it seemed—every living being who wasn’t playing football somewhere in Iowa was covering someone playing football somewhere in Iowa. Sports Editor Leighton Housh was patrolling the writers’ desks where Bill Bryson Sr.<span class="s45">21</span>, Buck Turnbull, Jim Moackler, and Ron Maly were racing toward their personal deadlines, pounding out stories on typewriters that emitted the ‘chik’ ‘chik-chik’ ‘chik’- sound of those</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">old metal key-action Smith-Coronas.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, Bill Dwyre<span class="s45">22</span>, Ron’s Maly’s brother Phil, Larry “Laddy” Paul and Copy Chief Howard Kluender were at the editor’s ring, heads down, pencils slashing through sloppy copy, replacing it with elegant, brief sen- tences, designed to be read over coffee in the morning edition.</p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: right;">When a break came in the action, Housh came</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">ing to step up and seize the opportunity when we have the chance—come to all of us sooner or later. Ethnicity has very little to do with it. Mine was a quiet triumph. In seeking an objective that I felt prepared to handle, I was confirming both parental guidance and personal observation of the way things could be.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Integration is a part of this time in my life: when I was hired as a coffee boy, sports phone desk person and copy runner, I was the only African American on the <i>Register </i>editorial staff.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Soon after I was hired, though, other African Americans followed: photographers Ron Bayles and (fellow North High graduate and NHS Hall of Fame Inductee) David Lewis came onboard, as well as the (great) feature writer (and another North High gradu- ate) Elenora E. Tate. Each brought extremely high levels of professionalism to the job.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Another important milestone that I should note: after serving for a few months as coffee boy and copy</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">runner, I was reporting on high school sports events and learning the ropes of general assignment reporting. On April 4th 1968, I was on the spot for the reporting break of a lifetime—which sadly, was connected to the death of a great American hero. Martin Luther King’s assassination was an earthshaking event, and in the wake of his murder Black communities across the na- tion erupted in rioting and what amounted to a com- munal scream of pain, anger and sorrow.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Des Moines’ Black community also ignited in vio- lence that consumed the central corridor along Univer- sity Avenue. I was in the sports department when I was</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">approached by the city editor with a question: Would I be able to grab a camera and go to the area of the rioting to take pictures and report on what might be happen- ing?</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Before I knew it, I was stepping over fire hoses in the street, avoiding the police who were trying to keep order, and estimating the size of the groups of people who were either part of the action or observers. Mar- tin’s death was a tragedy that I felt viscerally, but I was being given a chance to contribute to the reporting of a major news story. In later years, I learned that event was a sad but important launching pad for more than a</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Protest agaInst the <span class="s10">V</span>Iet nam war In <span class="s10">1968, </span>at <span class="s10">d</span>rake <span class="s10">u</span>nIVersIty</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a<span class="s11">ntI</span>-<span class="s11">raCIsm Protest at </span>d<span class="s11">rake </span>u<span class="s11">nIVersIty In </span>1968</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">few other Black journalists of that era, including the late Ed Bradley. After that night, I was moved to general as- signment reporting covering stories including the Iowa legislature.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Thankfully, my faith in my ability to attain a job that I wanted was greater than my fear of being rejected. Racist messages, seeking to sow fear and doubt about people of color, were as strong then as they are now. Knowing about my family’s experiences in Iowa over the last 100-plus years, though, helped provide me with the perspective I would need to navigate a new world for which there were few road maps.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Looking back on it, I think the best thing about my time at the <i>Des Moines Register </i>was acquiring great research skills. The esteemed Iowa author Bill Bryson<span class="s45">23 </span>and I both began working for the <i>Des Moines Register </i>while still in high school. His father, Bill Bryson Sr. was one of the nation’s great sports writers. Bill Jr. and I were high school-age copy runners and cub reporters learn- ing the ropes, but we began a friendship that contin-</p><p style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 143pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">ues to this day. Those who love Bill’s body of work ap- preciate granular research combined with the wit of a happy sage. Bill began developing those gor- geous research skills whilst searching out obscure bits of information in the <i>Reg- isters’ </i>vast archive of clip files in 1967-68.</p><p style="padding-left: 141pt;text-indent: 25pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">The investigative re- porter is the original Goo- gle. They never rest, and they never stop turning over rocks to find the truth. Learning where to look, whom to ask, and whom to “socially engineer” have always been the hallmarks of those who went out and got the story, and got it right. Pulitzer-Prize-win- ning writers like Nathan ‘Nick’ Kotz<span class="s45">24 </span>and the <i>Regis-</i></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;"><i>ter’s </i>own Clark Mollenhoff<span class="s45">25 </span>were the kind of reporters that we need vastly more of today.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Then, in 1968, my journalistic worlds became a lit- tle too well integrated. Let me explain:</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">During my sophomore year at Drake, I was the sports editor of the University’s student paper, the <i>Times-Delphic</i><span class="s45">26</span>, while at the same time I was now a Po- lice Beat reporter for the <i>Register</i>. As an 18-year-old, I was doing pretty well. I was getting lots of opportuni- ties, and like a hungry kid at a banquet I was grabbing everything I could.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Late in the 1968-69 Drake Basketball season the Bulldogs were playing a pivotal Missouri Valley Con- ference game at Veterans Memorial Auditorium. Mean- while, I was on police beat at the police station across the Des Moines River to the south and east of the au- ditorium.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">I was monitoring the police radio, which was my job, waiting for something to happen. Meanwhile, the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">little AM radio on the shelf was tuned to the basket- ball game and crackling with excitement. WHO radio broadcaster Jim Zabel was going crazy as the Bulldogs were in a very close contest.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Man, how did this happen? <span class="p">I thought. </span>I’m the Sports Editor; how come I’m up here at the cop shop, dammit?!</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Well, as 18-year-olds will do, I decided to take a chance. I could leave the station, hightail it up to the auditorium, grab some of the action and take a few pic- tures for the next edition of the <i>T-D</i>. What could go wrong?</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Well…upon my return to the copy desk after my shift at the station, I was asked how the game went? My attempt at playing dumb was unmasked by the fact that the game was broadcast on TV (duh?) and my face had clearly been visible among those on the sidelines. The press passes giveth and the press passes taketh away. Luckily there had been no murders, fires, robberies or</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">play my life looking for something to help me deal with something deep that I hadn’t dealt with previously. The more I concentrated, the more I began to remember events surrounding my parents’ breakup that I hadn’t allowed myself to revisit ever before.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: right;">At the time when a young man most needs the closest guidance to navigate the path into manhood, I was without my captain. Adding to the chaos, we were forced to move out of our house because of something called Urban Renewal<span class="s45">28</span>. I learned that urban renewal was actually short hand for “build a big new freeway— over land formerly known as the Black neighborhood.”</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Our little home, located at 1434 Walker St., was to be leveled to make way for the new freeway.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">So: wow, first Dad is gone and now the city is tell- ing us they can just take our house and offer compen- sation based on their assessment, not our asking price. Mom was able eventually to find us a new home in the</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">even kittens up a Union Park neigh-</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">tree during my ab- sence, but my two- places-at-once act became office leg- end at the pre-Gan- nett <i>Register</i>.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">The tragedy of the Kent State Massacre in May of 1970 triggered deep evaluation for me: Who was I, really? What was I doing here?</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 21pt;text-align: left;">Where else should I be? Why couldn’t I ever</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">relax and how could I regain equilibrium?</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">borhood. Surpris- ingly, the move turned out to be a very cool thing, because instead of being held at a middle school,</p><h3 style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: left;">The Wobble            <u>                                                                                                      </u></h3><h3 style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Begins</h3><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">my new 9th grade classes convened at</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">There was no doubt that my balancing act was getting to be a serious handful. Music, academics, a budding journalism career, the ever-present civil rights struggle and war worries were weighing on my mind.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">It was also getting increasingly difficult for me to ignore internal questions about my absent father. Like that annoying small stone in your shoe, it wasn’t long before—one way or another—I was going to have to stop along the path to deal with it.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">The tragedy of the Kent State Massacre<span class="s45">27 </span>in May of 1970 triggered deep evaluation for me: Who was I, really? What was I doing here? Where else should I be? Why couldn’t I ever relax, and how could I regain equi- librium?</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: left;">Like reviewing old movie footage, I began to re-</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">North High School, so I got to attend high school a year early. This wouldn’t be the last time a perceived negative would transform itself to my advantage. Flashing back to the present, I realize that attending classes at Drake was becoming burdensome because I simply had too many commitments and no time for rest or reflection.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">As for Viet Nam—another stressor at the time— Mom hadn’t even wanted me to join the Cub Scouts so, the military was completely out of the question. As she told me with fire in her eye: “I’ll send you to Canada myself before I’d let them have you for that war!”</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">In an atmosphere of so much turmoil, I was really missing my father’s influence in my life. Telling myself</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">that I didn’t care, or that it didn’t matter wasn’t working for me anymore. In the spring of 1969, I was sitting in my office at Drake when I had a revelation-like flash: I’m a reporter. I can find out everything else; why don’t I find my father? Wow! good question Dartanyan. What would a good reporter do?</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">I decided a good reporter would try the musicians’ union. I got the number for the New York Musicians Union Local 212, placed the call and asked: “Hello? Can you give me contact information for Ellsworth Brown please?”</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">“Just a minute…yeah we’ve got a number right here for you.”</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Holy crap. I had my Dad’s phone number. Now the question was: “Do I reeeallly want to make the call?”</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">No longer able to quell the inner chaos that draped over me like a heavy overcoat, I dialed the number in hopes that some resolution might be gained from clos- ing this long unresolved circle. Hearing his “hello” on the other end of the line, I felt like a salmon arriving back upstream to its spawning grounds. My father’s voice resolved the suspended chords of my life. I think we were both relieved that we were still alive and that positive energy seemed to attend our reunion. We filled</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">each other in on some key points. Yes, Ellsworth was still a working musician, living on Staten Island. No, Dartanyan didn’t play a lot because he was in college, and working as a journalist.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">That call was the coolest thing ever, and after it I updated my brothers Don and Kevan on the news. Re- connecting with dad was literally life changing, as all three of us would try, with varying degrees of success, to rebuild a relationship with Ellsworth and to make up for the time lost.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">After the call, I resolved to go to NYC to see dad during my Spring break.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Our reunion was pretty crazy. We obviously had love for each other, but it was also obvious that, gen- erationally speaking, we had developed very different views of the world. Example: I played electric bass and Dad thought all electric instruments were illegitimate. It was a great first meeting, though, and when it was time for me to return to Des Moines, I found out that, in addition to his music, Dad had high respect for Ger- man engineering. He was an excellent Volkswagen and Mercedes repairman, and gifted me with a Volkswagen bus from his small collection of vehicles.</p><p style="padding-left: 77pt;text-indent: -45pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Upon my return to Des Moines, I knew that my life trajectory was changing. Youthful frustration with the hypocrisy of the Viet Nam war was palpable. We intuitively knew that the government’s intentions were not what they were said to be. Our generation had to be both courageous and outrageous enough to look beyond the stories we were being told and to find out for ourselves how to enact our mor- als.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">w<span class="s11">heatstraw  on  stage  In  </span>g<span class="s11">reenwood  </span>P<span class="s11">ark  In  </span>d<span class="s11">es  </span>m<span class="s11">oInes</span>: r<span class="s11">on  </span>d<span class="s11">ewItte  </span>(<span class="s11">guI</span>-</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">tar<span class="s10">), d</span>artanyan  <span class="s10">(</span>bass<span class="s10">) </span>and  <span class="s10">d</span>aVId  <span class="s10">b</span>ernsteIn  <span class="s10">(</span>on  drums<span class="s10">).

My grades were going down, and staying up until 2 a.m. jamming with my musician friends wasn’t really help- ing me in classes. Something was going to give; I just wasn’t prepared for how it would happen.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">I was spending more time playing with musicians in town and discovering</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">where jazz, blues, rock, and even country players were jamming and experimenting. There were always ador- ing fans at these happenings.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Des Moines might have been Hicksville in some ways, but marijuana still found its way there just like ev- erywhere else in the 60s. In fact, it was hard NOT to run into the plant during those days. I mentioned my tee-to- taling folks earlier in this story and, of course, they had the same attitude about pot. While I wasn’t partaking (yet) it was always being offered...and I usually declined.</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Well… and….</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">One time a gal offered me a half-smoked joint and I didn’t want to be impolite, so I took her half-smoked gift and stuck it in my billfold saying, “If it’s ok with you, I’ll save it for later.” Famous last words.</p><h3 style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: left;">Busted</h3><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Later that evening, I was</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">moment, my life passed before me and I knew it wasn’t going to be ok for a while.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Twenty years of building, working, preparing, praying and striving were (as I thought at the time) about to be completely wiped away. A roach no bigger than my fingernail blew up my life as completely as if I had set off a bomb. Which, in fact I had. Taken to jail, I had to call my mother to bail me out, and you can be- lieve I’ll never forget the look on her face.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Of course, I went from covering the news to <i>being </i>the news in the worst way possible. The sense of shame was searing. The hopes and aspirations of many in my family and community were upended with my arrest for what amounted to the politically motivated machina- tions of Richard Nixon. Fifty years later, when in many cases we refer to marijuana as medicine, it seems a trag- edy that he had the power to alter so many lives for a</p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: right;">craven political</p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: right;">motive.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">driving my new- ly acquired VW bus near campus when, all of a sudden, the jar- ring lights of a police car in my</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Funny what joining a $90-a-week Blues band</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">and leaving town will do for your crushed ego. I learned to care again. I started to care about my- self and slowly dare to rebuild a value system.</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">To say I was</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">forever scarred by the experi- ence was under- statement. The real, deeper les- sons of the expe-</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">rearview mirror brought me to attention. In the best of times, Black guys don’t want to see flashing police lights in your review mirror. Upon request, I offered up my ID and waited for everything to be ok. I hadn’t gotten my permanent license plates for the bus yet…but I had the paper temporary permit, which was taped, to the rear window.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Well, he looked at my driver’s license, looked at me, looked at my license again…and then told me that I was under arrest!!?! He kind of grinned as he held up my driver’s license so I could see….something..stuck.. on..my..license?!</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Jeez, I mean, how often do you hand a policeman your driver’s license…with a marijuana roach stuck to it? While he held it out in front of me, I took a last des- perate opportunity to ‘save myself.’ I grabbed the roach and stuck it in my mouth and swallowed it. He didn’t seem to know whether to laugh or hit me, but in that</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">rience took some time for me to tease out of the chaos.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">At this lowest point in my life thus far, I was ready to chuck it all. As I was sinking, though, I was thrown a lifeline. It was called Wheatstraw….</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">In April 1970, musicians Ron Dewitte, Craig Horn- er and David Bernstein asked me to join their band, and since the band’s former bass player (whom I replaced) owned its former name, “The American Legend,” we’d have to find a new name. We were blues addicts at this time, and there was an obscure guy named Petey Wheatstraw. We thought that name (also on cigarette papers of that time) was funny, so we went with it for a band name.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Funny what joining a $90-a-week Blues band and leaving town will do for your crushed ego. I learned to care again. I started to care about myself and slowly dare to rebuild a value system. My searing sense of failure began to ease as I devoted many hours to practice, lis-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: left;">a <span class="s11">symPhony In brown Crushed VelVet</span>: d<span class="s11">artanyan In </span>s<span class="s11">Ix the </span>h<span class="s11">ard </span>w<span class="s11">ay aFter It morPhed From </span>w<span class="s11">heatstraw</span></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">tening, analyzing and performing with my new band mates.</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">long hours practicing and listening to everyone from John Coltrane<span class="s45">29 </span>to Jimi Hendrix. Importantly, I discovered that culture isn’t just about famous individu- als. It’s what my friend, University of In- diana music professor David Baker, de- scribed as the Inner Circles vs. the Outer Circles. The marketplace needs “stars” (outer circles) for sure, but the real “capil- laries of culture” (inner circles) are those local masters of community knowledge and custom who often remain unknown beyond their locality. So, while you may not have heard of Ron Dewitte, Craig Horner or David Bernstein, there was no doubt these guys dedicated their lives to expressing musical truth. Wheatstraw spent a fair amount of time on the road during 1970-72, playing the Midwestern states of Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois and Minnesota.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">It was in Wisconsin that a new chap- ter was getting ready to begin for me, but I sure didn’t recognize it at the time.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">The first time I heard Bill Chase<span class="s45">30 </span>was when Wheatstraw was booked at Ju-</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">It was also a good thing that I was now actually communicating with my father. With his help, I eventu- ally came to see that leaving college was a personal reset that put my life on a more sentient path. It sure beat going to Viet Nam to kill (or be killed) by folks I didn’t even know.</p><h3 style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: left;">Last Resort?</h3><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">I might not have considered leaving everything behind to join a blues band if it hadn’t been for guitar- ist Ron Dewitte, who was eventually inducted into the Iowa Blues Hall of Fame with me in 2010. He was one of the most expressive blues guitar players I had ever heard. The touch, timing and fire that distinguished his playing rivaled anything I’d ever heard from anyone short of Jimi Hendrix. Craig Horner, our keyboardist and trumpet player, was also a fine musician who spent</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 4pt;text-align: left;">dy’s Gin Mill (!), a beer bar in Fond du Lac Wisconsin.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">It was a Friday afternoon and David, Ronnie and I were sitting around our hotel room doing basically nothing. Things were calm until Craig literally burst through the door (knocking over a nightstand in the process) and leaped to the record player. He took the record that was playing on the turntable and frisbee’d it across the room. Replacing it with one he held, he said: “You guys are NOT going to believe this...!”</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">And with that, we heard the first track of Chase’s first album entitled “Open Up Wide ”</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Once I peeled my brain off the ceiling, I researched Bill Chase and discovered he’d been a star trumpet so- loist for big bands of the 60s, including Maynard Fer- guson<span class="s45">31</span>, Woody Herman<span class="s45">32 </span>and Stan Kenton<span class="s45">33</span>. Bill was a monster trumpet player and now he was a band leader whose first single (“Get It On”) would become an inter- national hit song.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Hearing the album definitely changed my impres- sions of what music could be; but at the time, I had no idea that Chase’s music would literally reshape my life about 24 months from that moment. Wheatstraw toured for two more years, surviving until 1972, when in desperation we became Six the Hard Way (don’t ask...). Reality finally caught up to us, though, and I went back to Des Moines to write music and finish a journalism degree. Or so I thought…</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">When I returned to Des Moines after the Wheatstraw ex- perience, I formed my first working group, called Dyna- mite. It was an ex- tremely funky quartet featuring members Phil Aaberg on pia- no, Rod Chaffee on guitar, Tom Gordon on drums, and yours truly on bass guitar. A band of writers, we played bluesy- jazzy roots music that morphed from one style to another with great relish. Our in- fluences were as wide ranging as John Col- trane, Paul Butter- field, John Cage<span class="s45">34</span>, the group Tree (an Iowa</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">earlier). Tommy was a great drummer who rightly jumped at the chance to play with Bill. Of course, that meant the end of our great little Des Moines band but things were far from boring....</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">After Tommy left town, I collaborated with John Rowat, Bill Jacobs and Michael Schomers to start a band called The Mothership. It was another more experimen- tal band with jazz/rock/country influences. We had a band house on the SE corner of Des Moines on Army</p><p style="padding-left: 182pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Post Road. Next door to our house there was a big roadhouse called the 505 Club (which everyone called “The Five.” It was notorious as what I would call a “cowboy punch out” bar. It was a rough joint, but the music that got played in there was worth the risk of injury or dis- memberment.</p><p style="padding-left: 182pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">The Five was owned and managed by Dick Kampus, a large and hearty man with a real lust for throwing a party, The Five was the</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">City Free Jazz collec- tive), Donny Hatha- way<span class="s45">35 </span>and the Sons of</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">C<span class="s11">hase</span>’<span class="s11">s  seCond  album </span>“e<span class="s11">nnea</span>” <span class="s11">Came  out  not  long  beFore  </span>b<span class="s11">Ill  </span>C<span class="s11">hase  Called</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">d<span class="s11">artanyan  uP  to  the  bIg</span>-<span class="s11">tIme</span></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">classic edge-of- town bar which even the local</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Champlin<span class="s45">36</span>.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Dynamite was a fun band with talent to burn, but unfortunately for us (though fortunately for my future), through a connection to the Kansas band The Fabulous Flippers<span class="s45">37</span>, our drummer, Tommy Gordon was called up to the “big time” to play with…Bill Chase!! (Chase’s sec- ond album, “Ennea,” had been released a few months</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">police didn’t mess with too much because it was that rough.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Over the years, we saw lots of different groups there. Funky horn groups like the previously mentioned Flippers, singer Marvin Spencer<span class="s45">38</span>, and lots of groups from Kansas, Florida, Louisiana and elsewhere. The list of bands that toured the roadhouse circuit to carve out a</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">career is long. I was at home next door to the club when one day the phone rang....</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">I picked it up. “ Hello,” I said.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">“Hey Dart,” said the excited voice on the other end, “Get your ass over here now and hear this. !” I recog-</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">nized the voice as Dick’s from across the driveway at the Five.</p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">“What are you talking about, man?” I queried. “Just get over here NOW, you won’t believe it.”</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">As I loped across the expanse of white gravel, I heard the rhythmic thud of bass guitar and drums coming through the walls of the club. As I got closer to the door, the syncopation was getting “too good” if you know what I mean. By the time I entered the cav- ernous club, it only took another two or three minutes to realize that something special was happening on the stage—and this was just rehearsal.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">The group rehearsing for the evening’s show was Wayne Cochran</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">note, Brent—a dynamite arranger—would later con- tribute charts to Bill Chase’s second album, “Ennea.”)</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Well, I listened transfixed as I watched Jaco cre- ating totally loose, but on-the-mark bass grooves. His sensibilities for groove and support and melodic bass playing were strangely scary, but at the same time an affirmation of where I knew the instrument could go.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">After the rehearsal, I made a beeline for the stage and introduced myself to Jaco. Being an old newspaper reporter, I wasn’t going to miss an opportunity to “in- terview” this guy to find out where he got his bouncy, funky style.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">I offered our house next door if he wanted to hang out with us, and for the next 3 days I played host to the Future Of Jazz Electric Bass! We jammed, talked, went to the Cochran gig, then jammed some more, talked a lot more about life, our families, Miles, and why each of us had a lot to offer. I have never met a more honest, car-</p><p style="padding-left: 178pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">ing, sensitive and</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">and his band, the CC Riders<span class="s45">39</span>. For those of you unfa- miliar with the tra- dition, Wayne Co- chran was a White soul singer in the tradition of James Brown. The cool</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 20pt;text-align: left;">I listened transfixed as I watched Jaco cre-</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">ating totally loose, but on-the-mark bass grooves. His sensibilities for groove and sup- port and melodic bass playing were strangely scary, but at the same time an affirmation of where I knew the instrument could go.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">talented individual than Jaco Pastorius in 1972.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">While Jaco was a natural mu- sician whose father played drums, he’d also studied with Ira Sullivan<span class="s45">46 </span>at</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">thing about Co- the University of</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">chran was that he, like Brown, was the real deal. He was a loud, signifyin’, funkified White boy who could drive an audience as well as any R&amp;B veteran I ever saw. But I digress....</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: right;">Cochran’s energy emanated as much from his band as from his own nasty soul. The band’s engine was being stoked by a tall skinny kid on bass who they called Jaco. “Jaco” was Jaco Pastorius<span class="s45">40</span>, later bass player for Weather Report<span class="s45">41</span>, which—alongside Miles Davis’s<span class="s45">42 </span>electric bands, the Mahavishnu Orchestra<span class="s45">43</span>, Return to Forever<span class="s45">44</span>, and Headhunters<span class="s45">45</span>—was one of the most important jazz fusion bands of the 70s and 80s. When I saw him at the Five, though, Jaco was the heart of Wayne Cochran and the CC Riders’ rhythm section, which also included guitarist Charlie Brent. (As a side</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Miami<span class="s45">47</span>. His mom Greta was someone he was totally devoted to. Jaco already had a young family then, and it was his single-minded goal to support his family by convincing everyone that he was the world’s greatest bass player!</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">He was convinced of that fact (I certainly wasn’t going to disagree, based on what I had heard) and he told me of his plans to leave the Cochran band soon and travel to Boston to join up with a new friend named Pat Metheny<span class="s45">48</span>. Metheny, he said, offered him an opportuni- ty to teach at Berklee College of Music<span class="s45">49 </span>in Boston. In 1976, Metheny—who was then only 21—would make his seminal debut recording “Bright Size Life”<span class="s45">50 </span>on ECM with Jaco. Later in 1974, Pastorius and Metheny joined pianist Paul Bley and drummer Bruce Ditmas to record</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: left;">an album on Bley’s Improvising Artists<span class="s45">51 </span>label).</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Anyway, the three days spent with Jaco could only be termed as a meeting of kindred spirits. The next time I saw him was 1976 at the Newport Jazz Festival<span class="s45">52</span>. By then he was with Weather Report and a true star. The best thing was, when I saw him again, he actually spot- ted me at the back of a large auditorium (Alice Tully Hall, I think) as I was walking in for Weather Report’s sound check.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">From the stage, he saw me (barely visible I was) and yelled at the top of his lungs “Hey DARTANYAN, HOW YA DOIN’.” It was a testament to his eyesight, his memory and his heart that he actually remembered our time together after HIS life had changed so radically.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">One sad note: The Jaco I knew in 1972 was on a natural high of life. He neither smoked, nor drank, nor even talked about anything but the most inspiring sub- jects. His goal was to play with Miles Davis. Period. He knew he was good enough, musical enough, and hip enough and that was that!</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">I never saw Jaco again after Newport. Back in 1972, he had told me that he had a chemical imbalance that meant his sensitive system could not tolerate most drugs or any alcohol. Moving to NYC was probably the worst thing he could have done because the influences on him at that time were uniformly bad. Every time news came in about him it was usually great professional triumph but leavened with the sad news of his descent into drug and alcohol abuse. Still, I’ll always have memories (and the tapes) of the Jaco Pastorius I knew, who propelled Wayne Cochran and the CC riders in ‘72. Bless you Jaco.</p><h3 style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: left;">Back to Bill....</h3><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">It was now spring ‘73 and, as I mentioned earlier, Tommy Gordon, our drummer in Dynamite, had al- ready joined Chase through his Fabulous Flippers con- nection. Former members of that group were touring with Bill touring in support of the “Ennea” album, so Tommy’s connection from years earlier had paid off. It was about to do the same for me.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">I was in my kitchen making a sandwich when the phone rang.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">I picked it up with my mouth half-full and almost choked when the voice on the other end said. “Hello,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">d<span class="s11">artanyan  saIlIng  on  stage  when  he  was  a  member  oF</span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">C<span class="s11">hase</span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: left;">this is Bill Chase.”</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Needless to say, I was nervous and incredulous as he laid out his offer.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">“I’ve been looking for a new bass player and Tom- my says that you’re a great bass player and a singer too.” I didn’t quite know what to say except to try to agree without sounding too egotistical (unlike my friend Jaco, who would have had no problem promoting himself).</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">“We have a tour due to start in El Paso, Texas in two weeks,” Bill said. “Do you think you can make the gig?”</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">He asked me if I knew the music and I said that I knew the first album from listening, but that was it. He said, “No matter, we’ve got all the charts.”</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">I just said a little prayer of thanks that I was play- ing in the Drake University Jazz band with Bob Weast<span class="s45">53</span>.

Once, famously, its herds blackened the Great Plains, sustaining the Plains Indians who hunted them. During the late 18th century, an estimated 60 million bison roamed the middle section of North America. Then came America’s westward expansion, and the huge herds were nearly exterminated, dwindling to less than 550 animals by 1889. Strenuous conservation efforts brought the bison back from the brink, and the population has rebounded to roughly a half-million animals.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">Vocalization<a href="http://www.nps.gov/articles/bison-bellows-6-23-16" class="s6" target="_blank">: According to the National Park Service (https://www.nps.gov/articles/bison-bellows-6-23-16.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">htm), bison make a variety of sounds.

The setting sun glints off shallow water, adding a rosy glow to the gray and brown of the crane’s outstretched wings. As the flock banks and descends, the air is filled with the calls of ducks, geese, herons, egrets, and the many shorebirds that are also visiting the marsh to rest and refuel. An incredible forty-five percent of all North American shorebirds arrive at this Kansas marsh, known as Cheyenne Bottoms (https://ksoutdoors.com/ KDWPT-Info/Locations/Wildlife-Areas/Southwest/</p><p style="padding-left: 188pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">Cheyenne-Bottoms), each year during their spring and fall migra- tions. Cheyenne Bot- toms, the largest inland marsh in the United States, is vitally import- ant to the survival of many shorebirds. It also brings 60,000 people to the area each year, pro- viding an opportunity for both children and adults to learn about the importance of wet- lands and the animals who live there.</p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: right;">Although few</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: left;">a<span class="s11">merICan  whIte  PelICans</span>, <span class="s11">Cormorants</span>, <span class="s11">gulls  and  assorted  other  waterFowl  gather  on  a sPIt  at  </span>C<span class="s11">heyenne  </span>b<span class="s11">ottoms</span>. <span class="s11">Photos  by  </span>k<span class="s11">aleb  </span>k<span class="s11">roeker  unless  otherwIse  noted</span></p><p style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: left;">would guess it, Kansas</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">*References listed in Endnotes</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">contains one of the most crucial shorebird stopping places in the western hemisphere. Each spring tiny western sandpipers, weighing only 0.8 to 1.2 ounces, leave their winter homes in the south to fly from 900 to 2,500 miles to reach their Alaskan breeding grounds. These diminutive sandpipers must be able to find ar- eas of marsh, swamp, or beach where they can rest and store body fat to accomplish their marathon migration. If the birds are unable to find enough food in one spot, they will be forced to stop again. Too much delay will cause the birds to arrive late to their summer breeding grounds. If too much of the short Arctic summer has been wasted, some of the birds may choose not to mate. Since the United States contains only three large shore- bird stopping places east of the Rockies, Cheyenne Bot- toms is clearly indispensable.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">If you visit Cheyenne Bottoms in late October or early November, in addition to seeing many ducks, geese, and various shorebirds, you might be lucky enough to spot an endangered whooping crane. In 1941 these tall white cranes numbered only sixteen. Now there are nearly 300, partly thanks to safe havens like Cheyenne Bottoms. Other protected or endangered species that visit the marsh are the bald eagle, piping plover, and peregrine falcon. The wetlands have been designated as a critical habitat for both whooping cranes and the interior least tern.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Before the arrival of Francisco Coronado, only the native Indian tribes, such as the Cheyenne, after whom Cheyenne Bottoms is named, knew of this place.

Others who were interested in creating a wildlife refuge at Cheyenne joined with Robl to testify before the Senate Committee on Wildlife, and he even contacted then-</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">the world how important Cheyenne Bottoms was and helped protect the wetlands for many more generations of birds.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">In 1966, Edmund Martinez became interested in banding the birds of Cheyenne Bottoms.

Robel and Martinez, who invested their lives in studying, understanding, and protecting Cheyenne Bottoms, have made it possible for us to visit the marsh, see the sun sparkle on the shallow water, hear the raucous calling of geese, and crane our necks to see flocks of thousands wheel in the sky.

Gray skies. A cold drizzle. Not an optimal day to go for a prairie hike. But you hike</p><p style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.facebook.com/hins-" class="s6" target="_blank">when you have time to hike, and weather be hanged. To- day, Hinsdale Prairie (https://www.faceboo</a>k.com/hins- daleprairie) steward Kath Thomas has promised me a tour of a prairie remnant, just down the street from her house. Not much more than an acre, it’s a tiny remnant island adrift in a sea of development.</p><p style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">What’s a prairie remnant? Simply put, it’s a piece of the original tallgrass prairie that has not been plowed or destroyed. Illinois once had 22 million acres of tallgrass prairie; only about 2,300 high quality acres remain. Other Midwestern states have even more dismal statis- tics. These remnants are often tucked into old cemeter- ies, or the corners of farm fields. Along railroad tracks. On rocky hilltops unsuitable for plowing. Or, places like this alongside a freeway that escaped notice.</p><p style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Mowers have knocked back the prairie on the free- way side and it’s been trimmed back along the sidewalk which flanks it on the west. There’s a roar of traffic from the freeway. The din is overwhelming. A prairie—here? Really? If there is birdsong, it’s erased by the sounds of</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: left;">trucks. And yet…you feel it. This is a special place.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">As we hike, Kath points out the bluebird houses. Anybody home? Nope, not today. Too late in the sea- son. As we brush aside the tallgrass and hike deeper into the prairie, the real treasures emerge. Over here, spent prairie gentians. To the left, prairie dropseed, lime-col- ored for autumn. Just ahead, the bloomed-out spikes of Liatris, blazing star, with a few ballet-skirted seedheads of Echinacea; pale purple coneflower.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Other treasures appear as we walk. Prairie dock. Some rough-cut leaves of compass plant. All of these tell us we’re walking through prairie, not an old field. Signs of a survivor. The rain starts up again. Wind and wet blur the grasses into a watercolor of motion.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">The rain also brings out the globe-dark silhouettes of rattlesnake master and pops of black-eyed Susan seedheads. I imagine these two plants in summer; their</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 325pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">t<span class="s11">he </span>“<span class="s11">rough</span>-<span class="s11">Cut</span>” <span class="s11">leaVes  oF  a  ComPass  Plant  In  Fall</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">a <span class="s11">neCessary PreCautIon</span>, <span class="s11">to keeP road maIntaInanCe Crews at bay</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: left;">flashes of silvery white and lemon yellow.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Reality, in the form of more cold drizzle, brings me back to the present. Kath will be the first to tell you this little prairie remnant is here because of Dr. Robert Betz, who identified prairie bush clover (<i>Lespedeza lep- tostachya</i>) here in the 1970s and championed the prai- rie’s survival. We don’t find the prairie bush clover as we hike today, but we do find round-headed bush clover. Not nearly so unusual, but still intriguing.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Look around and discover a jewelry box full of plant gems.

She founded “Friends of Hinsdale Prai- rie,” dedicated to advocating for the prairie on social media and with local government. She intercedes for the prairie when she sees unusual activity, like utility trucks parking on the grasses or neighbors throwing yard waste into the wildflowers. She picks up trash. Each day brings a new challenge.

Edgelands act like scrims rendering other spaces invisible, yet the edgelands are absent from most city maps. This waver- ing visibility seeps into my photographs and drawings: the soft villous hairs on the unfurling fern fronds are partially obscured by a puddle of green paint. Edge- lands are considered one of the last refuges of wildness. I photograph and draw the plants I discover in these overgrown patches of “weeds” as the seasons change. My images are as much about making visible this over- looked landscape as they are about documenting the</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">passage of time.</p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: right;">“The Prairie Constructs” are an ongoing series</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">which catalogs the life and death of plants from the ed- gelands of Minneapolis. Made almost entirely on the scanner bed, The Prairie Constructs are a digital version of a photogram or botanical solar print. The images are shown as both large-scale digital color prints and as an artist book or compendium, showing the evolution in the landscape over the course of a year. What started as a way of collecting bits and pieces of plants as the seasons change has turned into a methodical and some- times frenetic project of gathering and experimenting with each plant.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Since I often uncover synthetic materials, plastic bags mostly, as I collect plants I included these in the images as well.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Chance also plays an important role because the view from below of the scanner is not visible until the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 370pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">image appears on my screen. I place my materials within the frame and then document them as they re- act and evolve (melt, flow, crumple, wilt), often making multiple scans from a single combination of paint, photographs, plants and plastics. I orchestrate this “organic process” that is then recorded and amplified through digital technology.</p><p style="padding-left: 370pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Light is an important ingredient in the transformation of my materials and in the elevation of these spaces. I work with light when photographing the landscape, making the scans and installing the images. In traditional landscape painting, light can be in- terpreted as <i>lumen</i>, observed light, or <i>lux</i>, divine light or the light of rea- son. I prefer to think about light in terms of Heidegger’s description of <i>lichtung</i>, which translates as “light in a forest clearing.” He argues that openness must precede <i>lumen </i>and <i>lux</i>, observation and judgment. My work enables me to be open to the natural world that is around me, even in the city. It is this sense of wonder and awareness about the persistence of urban nature that I want to pass on to viewers through my images.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: left;">“P<span class="s11">raIrIe </span>C<span class="s11">onstruCt </span>#41,&quot; a<span class="s11">rChIVal </span>I<span class="s11">nkjet </span>P<span class="s11">rInt</span>, 36 <span class="s11">x </span>54 <span class="s11">InChes</span>, <span class="s11">by </span>r<span class="s11">egan </span>g<span class="s11">olden</span>, 2015</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">C<span class="s11">loCkwIse From toP leFt</span>, “P<span class="s11">raIrIe </span>C<span class="s11">onstruCt </span>#23, #5, #37 &amp; #18,&quot; a<span class="s11">rChIVal </span>I<span class="s11">nkjet </span>P<span class="s11">rInt</span>, <span class="s11">eaCh Image </span>36</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">x <span class="s10">54 </span>InChes<span class="s10">, </span>by <span class="s10">r</span>egan <span class="s10">g</span>olden<span class="s10">, 2015</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 283pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 78%;text-align: left;">Book Review: <span class="s51">Building the Agricultural City: A Handbook for Rural Renewal </span>by Robert Wolf*</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 283pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">by <span class="s1">F</span>red <span class="s1">k</span>IrsChenmann</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">P<span class="s11">hoto Courtesy oF </span>F<span class="s11">red </span>k<span class="s11">IrsChenmann</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s52" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s29">Frederick L.

It may cause most of us—especially those living in rural areas—to believe that any alternative, positive future for rural America, like the one Wolf envisions, simply defies reality.</p><p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Nevertheless, in this inspiring book, Wolf provides</p><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">us with a practical scenario for how we could actually experience a rural renewal grounded in the evolution of a new paradigm. As Wolf points out, we now need to begin building regional, alternative “arks” that envi- sion alternative rural futures in which rural and urban</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">*References listed in Endnotes</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">98</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">communities are no longer separated, but become part of a <i>bioregion</i>, wherein rural and urban citizens work together to produce new communities that are driven by self-renewing regional capacities, in lieu of  the cur- rent dominating and centralized globalist economies. As Wolf says:</p><p style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Regionalism is precisely the means by which we can reconstruct society with a human face—if we have the collective will to do it. Regionalism is a form of decentralization, and is at odds with our overly centralized system, which seeks to impose uniformity in every sphere of activity (page 38).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s55" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Those who think such a future is unrealistic may want to also consult a new book by John Thackara, <span class="s3">How to Thrive in the Next Economy: Designing Tomorrow’s World Today </span><a href="http://www.thamesandhudsonusa.com/" class="s6" target="_blank">(https://www.th</a><span class="p">amesandhudsonusa.com/ books/how-to-thrive-in-the-next-economy-design- ing-tomorrows-world-today-hardcover)</span>, in which he points out, based on his travels around the world, that such rural/urban bio-regionalisms are, in fact, already happening in many parts of the world.</p><p class="s55" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: justify;">Of course, communities across the U.S. have been heavily influenced by the culture of the Green Revo- lution, which envisioned, and created, a food system designed to feed the world with cheap food produced by fewer farmers, thereby producing an industrial, in- put-intensive food system designed for “maximum, ef- ficient, production, for short-term economic return.” The Green Revolution’s proponents claim that bio-re- gional transformations are untenable. Viewed from this perspective, the industrial farming-and-food paradigm embodied in the Green Revolution seems inevitable, and many believe that science and technology will in- sure its resilience, and its economic efficiency ought to be enough to ensure its attractiveness. Wolf views this paradigm as a limit on our imagination, as it leads us to believe that the current order of things is simply the way things will always be. As Wolf says:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s55" style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Clearly, achieving greater self-sufficiency is not simply a technical problem.

It is imperative, he argues, that we explore an al- ternative food system and begin building it.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Of course, one of the many drivers of the Green Revolution model—as well as our enthusiasm sur- rounding it—was our collective assumption that the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">natural capital would always be there, throughout our industrial economy—and that new technologies would constantly be developed to replace it. Components of this natural capital would be healthy soil, cheap miner- als, plentiful fossil fuels, and abundant fresh water—all essential to the “success” of our Green Revolution food system.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Now we are beginning to recognize that many as- pects of this natural capital are in a state of depletion. As Wolf notes early in the book, “one of the distinguishing features of contemporary American civilization is the frequency of breakdowns and failures in industry, gov- ernment, and society itself. The size of the problem is enormous.”</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Take, for example, minerals. Rock phosphate— which is the “natural capital” from which we manufac- ture our phosphorus inputs—is now depleted to a point where we only have perhaps another ten year’s-worth of supply remaining on the planet. Or soil. Since we have paid little attention to restoring the health of our soils in our input-intensive systems, we need large quantities of fresh water for irrigation. This is due to the fact that most of our soils now only absorb about a half an inch</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">of rain water per hour, so we now use approximately 70 percent of our freshwater resources on the planet for ag- ricultural irrigation. All of this, of course, is beginning to increase costs and produce diminishing returns—es- pecially for farmers. In his recent book, <i>Growing a Rev- olution: Bringing Our Soil Back to Life </i>(https://books. wwnorton.com/books/detail.aspx?id=4294995584), David Montgomery provides concrete evidence of how some farmers are already beginning to alter their farm- ing systems because the input-intensive systems simply no longer produce positive economic returns for them. Instead of continuing to rely on external inputs, which are becoming more costly, they are beginning to employ practices that restore the natural capital, reducing the need for the inputs. These farmers are now reducing their costs, increasing their net profits, and are no lon- ger interested in “getting bigger.”</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">This begins to make clear why the revolution Rob- ert Wolf envisions is a practical necessity. Even if we only consider cheap energy, minerals, soil and water as part of the natural capital that has “sustained” our in- dustrial agriculture for the past century, we must recog- nize that they are all in a state of depletion. As Wolf duly</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">P<span class="s11">hoto by </span>j<span class="s11">on </span>a<span class="s11">ndelson</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">noted throughout his treatise, our industrial economy will, at best, only survive for another two or three decades:</p><p style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">The centralization of American government, fi- nance, and industry has grown extreme, to the extent that it governs our life and work. Such a system cannot long endure, and our various en- vironmental and social breakdowns are evidence of an ongoing crisis… Our institutions and corpo- rations have grown too large: everything exceeds human scale and has become inhuman. It is im- perative that we construct political and economic units in which people can once again find a home (page 23).</p><p style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">This search for a home, for the reconstruction of our self-reliance, is the compelling reason that Wolf ’s vision for the renewal of rural America, beginning with arks of refuge from industrial capitalism in places like the Driftless Region of the Upper Midwest, may seem strange to those of us still locked into the culture of the industrial economy. Wolf, looking back in our collective history, demonstrates how “early American history is replete with examples of local and regional self-reliance, from the Spanish Southwest to Yankee New England, from Chesapeake Bay to the Carolinas and Georgia.” Returning to that kind of regional self-reliance can play a central role in deconstructing the highly problematic political economy in which we live.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Those still not convinced may want to examine yet another recent publication by two of our leading agro- ecologists, Peter Rosset and Miguel Altieri: <i>Agroecolo- gy: Science and Politics </i>(https://developmentbookshop. com/agroecology-science-and-politics)<i>. </i>Rosset and Altieri highlight the key fact that the majority of food that feeds the global population in today’s world is be- ing produced by smallholder farmers farming five acres or less! Going further, Rosset and Altieri point out that those smallholder farmers are already employing, and have been for millennia, the very kind of agro-ecolog- ical farming practices—grounded in “local autonomy, local markets and community action”—that Wolf envi- sions for a future America. Finally, it is also important to recognize that these “agro-ecological” farming prac-</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">tices, which Rosset and Altieri describe, are operating as “human-centered cultures” driven by community relationships, not by machine-like alternative perime- ter cultures that humans have to conform to—exactly the kind of human-centered culture that Wolf envisions for the Driftless region (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Driftless_Area) and eventually America’s future.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Finally, as we anticipate these future changes, Wolf suggests we embrace not more <i>technology</i>, but more <i>imagination</i>. Therefore, the arts can play a critical role in helping us to envision and adapt to this new future:</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Regionalism fosters a regional culture. <span class="p">Regionalism promotes the arts as a means of maintaining re- gional consciousness. Regional consciousness in turn fosters a willingness to work together, which in turn creates wealth (page 39).</span></p><p style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">From my perspective, Wolf ’s book is filled with important information—information that is vital for all of us to digest as we anticipate the changes coming at us, so that we can get an advanced start in preparing for them. Furthermore, by beginning to construct a few “arks” here and there, it becomes possible to demon- strate that the kind of human-centered, agro-ecological community farming which is already “feeding much of the world” could thrive in America. Doesn’t that seem like a good way to start this transformation?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 81pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 82%;text-align: left;">P<span class="s11">hoto  Courtesy  oF  </span>b<span class="s11">ruCe  </span>l<span class="s11">eVenthal</span>, <span class="s11">taken  on  </span>n<span class="s11">oVember  </span>5, 2016, <span class="s11">at  </span>F<span class="s11">ort  </span>s<span class="s11">nellIng  </span>s<span class="s11">tate </span>P<span class="s11">ark</span>, (s<span class="s11">t</span>.

One can actually see Earth as a globe - the slight curve of the horizon, where the winds come from that bend the grass and the few trees, and where the clouds gather that sweep overhead, only to disappear again and make way for the blue sky. Some- times, looking toward the horizon, I would feel an over- whelming joy, seeing mountains in the distance. It was usually a short emotion, as I realized that my mind had played tricks. Those were not mountains, could not be mountains. They were clouds that had swept me away toward home, mirroring a more familiar landscape.</p><p style="padding-left: 52pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Living on the Great Plains costs a lot of energy. The sky overhead is endless, and the people are exposed to that sky as if on a plate. Shelter becomes more than a physical necessity. Humility in the face of this force is self-imposing and sometimes overpowering. There is a connection between people and nature, because ev- erybody is exposed to forces that cannot be tamed or understood. At least, that is, until people started to sur- round themselves with constant shelter, as if to avoid having to look into that sky, to acknowledge the force, to be humble. Instead, they could now disconnect</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">themselves from nature, think of themselves as supe- rior, and think of distance in miles per hour, hurtling themselves quicker and quicker through the landscape they no longer needed to acknowledge, ripping up all their roots, at least the long, deep, strong roots that hold the grasses in place against the winds. Instead, they now plowed the earth and selected what roots were allowed to grow. And all of this cost even more energy because to be without roots requires one to levitate in place, nothing but a fleeting shadow over the land, which has become but an abstraction, no longer real because it is just land. There is no distinct smell of the earth, no change in winds that herald rain, no experience of sea- sonality, no need to observe closely how its other inhab- itants behave, no sharing of the landscape with them. Kinship and its obligations have been narrowed to the people in the shelter, and has been turned against those outside the shelter. And so, with the extraction of roots</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: left;">comes the need to extract more and more energy.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Energy has become visualized for me in the form of long trains of black tank cars and coal tenders mov- ing across the plains. When we lived in North Dako- ta, they were parked right next to the campus of the university where I taught, and I often wondered what would happen if the oil wagons exploded like they had done in Lac Megantique (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Lac-M%C3%A9gantic_rail_disaster) and right outside Casselton. Now that I live in Iowa, the same wagons rumble by our house about five times a week. Here, they are loaded with ethanol, not oil or coal, but the image of energy being transported to markets is the same. The Prairie-Plains are the heart that sends fuel to the out- liers. It is a restless procession of long trains, traveling through places that try to still be rooted, yet are more and more depopulated. People and grass have been up- rooted and swept away, and even those who have stayed</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">behind need heavy machinery to anchor them down, now that the roots are mostly gone and the shelterbelts are disappearing.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">There are other ways that the energy flows, of course. Pipelines cross the Plains like a vast network of pulsating arteries. Not veins, however, as there is not much coming back. Invisible, those lines are connected to the new artificial roots of hydraulic fracturing. These roots fan out from wells, which draw different nutri- ents out of the Earth, nutrients for the industrialized society. However, just like the roots of water-hungry plants, these new kinds of roots are also thirsty. They are thirsty for poisonous nutrients—oil and gas—that they extract, but they also put poisons into the Earth. Toxic materials are mixed into the water that is used for fracturing the rocks, and fracturing wells are extremely thirsty. In 2016, a well in the Bakken oil field (https:// en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakken_Formation) required</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">5.5 million gallons of water, while one in the Permian basin used 11.2 million gallons of water. In August of 2018, the Bakken had 12,571 producing oil wells. Some of this “water”, too, will flow back out. This is now called <i>produced water</i>, but it really has not much in common anymore with water. It is about twenty times saltier</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www/" class="s6" target="_blank">than ocean water, slightly radioactive, and highly tox- ic. Apart from its use in the artificial roots of hydraulic fracturing, it can not be allowed to ever come into con- tact with other roots. This brine needs to be disposed of, hopefully for ever, and it is usually injected back into the Earth. In the United States, about 180,000 Class II injection wells pump over 2 billion gallons of fluids into the Earth every day, most of them in the southern Plains. What happens when these fluids are not inject- ed deep enough or break free from their layers can be seen on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation (ht</a>tp://www. fortpecktribes.org) in Montana. Here, an underground brine plume has been migrating slowly through water wells for the past 40 years, a legacy of injection practices in the 1970s. Slowly spreading toward Poplar and the Missouri River, the only solution for this catastrophe has been to try and pump it to the surface again, and then to inject it deeper.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">The pulse of this network has become constant beneath the soil, and in some places, it has become so strong that it regularly causes small earthquakes. Whether or not these pulses will eventually set the liq- uids free is a matter of debate that will only be shown by time. If, however, any of the produced waters make</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">their way to the grass roots, people, plants, and animals will have to leave. Under the ground sleeps the greatest danger to communities. It might be a telling sign that a break in a produced water pipeline is much more im- pactful than a break in an oil pipeline.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">The Prairie-Plains have become the roots for the United States, where wheat, oil, soybeans, corn, and</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">ing a hundred miles further west. There are no Denbigh forests, no designed areas of seeds to fan out and protect the land against this new kind of industrialized havoc.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">The Denbigh trees were and still are an illustration of the possibilities to make roots. Like plants, animals and people can become rooted in a place. Humans do that by establishing a relationship with a place: by lis-</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">coal are extract- tening to the</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">ed from the soil to feed the cit- ies far away. Not much thought is spent on the roots.

It is the ability to find one’s way through the landscape of stories.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">landscape and its inhabitants. The stories that we learn and share in this process are our roots, they hold</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 4pt;text-align: left;">as boring and    <u>                                                                                                                     </u></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">colorless and are taken for grant-</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 4pt;text-align: left;">us to the places</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;">we engage with. It is hard to say</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.history.com/topics/great-depression/dust-bowl)" class="s6" target="_blank">ed. Eighty years ago, during the Dust Bowl (https:// </a><a href="http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/" class="s6" target="_blank">www.history.com/topics/great-depression/dust-bowl), the nation did come to realize that it had better pay at- tention to the roots when the topsoil was flying away. One of the best kept secrets of the Plains lies in Den- bigh, North Dakota, an assembly of houses off the main road to Minot. Across that road stands the Denbigh Experimental Forest (https://www.fs.usda.go</a>v/recarea/ dpg/recarea/?recid=80604). At first, it might come as a surprise that the ground in the forest is mostly sand. This sand is not the leftover of a prehistoric beach or long-ago glacier, but the result of much more recent overgrazing and over-plowing. In fact, the forest was planted as a grand plan to save the soil. It was one part of the national response to the destruction of the plains grass-, range-, and farmlands. The original plan called for planting a series of 100 mile long shelterbelts, a mile apart, over more than a thousand miles from North Da- kota to Texas. While this plan was eventually given up, between 1935 and 1942, the Forest Service planted 220 million trees in the Plains. Denbigh was to be one of the nurseries for these trees. Standing in the midst of these trees in the middle of nowhere, a tree island in a sea of industrialized agriculture, I found it hard not to think of the imagined and real root systems holding the soil and people in place and to compare it to the oil boom ongo-</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">how long it takes to become rooted. A few generations is my guess. Once we know the stories of all the plac- es around, above, and below us, we are rooted. By that time, we are also rooted in the ground because our an- cestors have related to the same places. Rooted knowing is not knowledge formally learned, but sensually expe- rienced. It is the knowledge of how the dirt smells and feels and tastes after a rainstorm. It is the ability to find one’s way through the landscape of stories. It is the skill to predict the weather by looking out the window and to estimate distances by how long it takes to walk along the contours of the land. And it is to understand that that we humans are just one of the parts in any place that we live, to be humble before greater forces with great and small powers. The energy of place is tied to roots, but those are the roots of community, not extraction.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">When I was younger, I used to mountain bike on the mountain behind the house where I lived in Swit- zerland. There is a place there where the trees give way to a cliff, and there I can experience my home. Look- ing out over the Sundgau, I can see the Belchendreieck, the mythical triangle of mountains in the Vosges, the Black Forest, and the Jura that served as an astronomi- cal calendar and a place power grid to the people before me. Looking west and north, there are possibilities of openness, promises of adventure, and winds of chance.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">I always longed to know what lay beyond the next ridge. The Plains, although topographically the opposite of my home in Switzerland, remind me of it, possibly because they offer an endless opportunity to go farther, a con- stant draw toward the horizon. Perhaps that is why I fell in love with the Plains the first time I traveled them.</p><p style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Few things are better than lying awake at night in a tent, smelling the sage, and watching the thunder- storms on the horizon parade by. Some people tell me that there is nothing on the Plains, that it is fly-over and drive-through country. They have never taken the dirt tracks to watch pelicans on remote lakes, have nev- er gotten stuck in Plains gumbo, have never observed ground squirrels playing around their tent. These days, I too hurry through the Plains to get places, and some- times I feel a pain for passing by all the places that I know lie right over the hills, in beautiful valleys, away from the interstates and the industrial fields. There is nothing as depressing as a flattened, brown, industrial- ized, ploughed landscape devoid of roots. There is noth-</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">ing as beautiful as a wide river valley with a sprinkling of savannah trees. To allow and make people see this beauty, we need to open the land to the public, to allow people onto the land, not in small, enclosed parcels, but in continuous flows, traveled in days, experienced close at hand. Observed, listened to, smelled, and tasted.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Ironically—or perhaps not at all—those land- scapes would also provide us with material energy. The energy returned over energy invested ratio for all those wagons full of corn ethanol that roll behind my house is lousy and unsustainable. Instead of plowing up the Native roots and replacing them every year with corn to provide to pigs and to distill into ethanol, the best use of this landscape would be to turn it back into switchgrass prairie. Ethanol production from switchgrass is about 5 to 6 times more efficient than ethanol production from corn. And while currently the research is directed at switchgrass monocultures, a true prairie flora could probably be used for the purpose, too. A green econ- omy for Iowa would see the restoration of switchgrass prairies and the harvest of the grass for ethanol produc-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">tion. That would also allow the restoration of roots to the land and a diverse plant and animal habitat. Sustain- ably planted islands of edible corn in this prairie instead of diminutive islands of prairie in a desert of corn and soybeans would still produce food. In the coming years, agriculture, just like everything else, will need to adjust to massive changes in climate and in energy use. We all need to re-learn to live with the land instead of against it. We will all need to re-learn the value of roots and how to maintain them.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">I am not advocating for a return to pre-industrial life; wind power generation will have to be a part of the solution on the Plains and Prairies. Wind turbines are rooted like prairie grasses and like the farmers who take care of the land. Instead of clearing the land of its roots, however, and watch people, native plants, animals, and everything else be swept away from it in the name of industry, we should emphasize this caretaking function of farming. In order to see prairie caretaking as farm- ing, we need to redefine the meaning of the term, farm- ing. But farming as caretaking of the landscape instead</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">of industrial extraction of resources would restore the powers of roots and enable those same roots to care for people. Instead of seeing that as a threat to farmers, I see it as a restoration of the true meaning of farming. Until industrialization, farming did not mean to rip out roots, but planting roots and at the same time taking care of existing root systems, nurturing the land for plants, an- imals, and communities.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 24pt;line-height: 89%;text-align: justify;">Ironically, people in exile are experts on roots. What we have learned is that roots cannot be forced. Roots need to grow naturally.
