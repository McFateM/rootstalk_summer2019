The map has led me to this unsought future  
but I’ve come to cosset its every unfolding  
  
like an aging cottonwood learns to curl its roots  
around the creatures born in the forest loam  
 
Still &emsp; in the starlight of dreams &emsp; I often return  
to that course I used to wind through the rural Midwest  

& immerse myself again in late summer’s haze  
of primroses &emsp; columbines &emsp; & great hay rolls  

all drowsing along the twilit roadside &emsp; I drive  
past the cornstalks’ muggy throngs reaching  

their nascent fingers to wrest the last sun-drops  
from the dome’s milky yawn &emsp; until the oaks  

grow drunk with nightfall &emsp; & the winged hosts  
soused among their leaves all break into song  
   
to wake me to my life  
 &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; a map on its head:  

East has become west &emsp; & west east  
for the Northern Lights always inviting  

themselves to swim on my horizon  

Though I’d have once been glad to drown  
in the luminescent breath of such interlopers
 
I now see their hold on me was only fleeting---&  
that tonight’s reverie was no more solemn &emsp; nor less
 
gratuitous &emsp; than it was to mistake the crackle from  
my gas fireplace I must have dreamed 

for a memory
