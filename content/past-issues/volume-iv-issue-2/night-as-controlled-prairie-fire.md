The star spore  
got sorted into sori  
by the people  
on the far shore  
who saw them press  
themselves against  
the wrong side  
of the fern in distinct  
patterns as though  
prone and pushing back  
the past and when they went  
ripe the indusium  
came away as night  
began all over again
