Musically as well as figuratively, Iowa-born singer-songwriter, [Pieta
Brown](https://www.pietabrown.com) honors the long sustain—a fact which
was amply evidenced by her sold-out fall 2017 performance in the
[Grinnell Area Arts Council’s](https://www.grinnellarts.org)
gallery space, backed by Grammy-award winning guitarist [Bo Ramsey](https://www.boramsey.com). Her layered refrains make for a
straightforward but lush musical atmosphere that recalls traditional
folk and blues, while her strong yet breathy vocals run more indie and
alt-country. It’s an infectious blend that ably supports Brown’s clear
sense of tradition and place. Put another way, her music epitomizes
contemporary Middle-America songwriting.

Watching her play, I found myself watching her fingers on the guitar
neck at the end of each song. On each song ending, she pressed the
strings and gently waved the neck, drawing the final sound out in a
reverent, lasting fade. This impression of that night has stayed with
me: that resonant, purposeful close, which was really an intention to
remain. After the concert, playing Brown’s music over the long Iowa
freeze, I managed to stay mindful of what was alive, woven as kith,
under the cold ground of our prairie winter. The roots that anchor the
tallgrasses, summer coneflowers, and September asters exemplify the sort
of anchoring that flourishes in Pieta Brown’s music. Her artistry honors
that long sustain of kinship and season.

“I really believe in the land-music connection,” Brown said.

Brown’s Iowa roots do run deep. She played the Art Center with renowned
guitarist and producer, Bo Ramsey, her accompanist and frequent
collaborator. In addition to his Grammy-winning guitar skills, Bo is a
highly respected producer and songwriter, and an inductee of both the
[Iowa Rock and Roll Hall of Fame](http://www.iowarocknroll.com) and the
[Iowa Blues Hall of Fame](http://cibs.org/events-programs/iowa-blues-hall-of-fame). Two of
Ramsey’s sons, Alex and Benson Ramsey, are in the band [The Pines](http://thepinesmusic.com), which played in the first [joint-offering](https://rootstalk.grinnell.edu/index.php/article/pines-concert)
from the Grinnell Arts Council and the Center for Prairie Studies, back
in January of 2017. Ramsey
is also a long-time friend and collaborator with Pieta Brown’s father,
[Greg Brown](https://gregbrownmusic.org), another colossal Iowa music
talent. Greg Brown is known for his hybrid style of blues, folk, and
rock, and for songs like “Iowa Waltz.” Greg Brown’s wife—Pieta’s
stepmother—is the singer-songwriter [Iris DeMent](https://www.irisdement.com).

“I grew up in Iowa,” Brown told the crowd. She described childhood
memories of living in a remote, rural home somewhere outside Iowa City,
a “shack, really.” She said she had driven around in recent years
looking for that house, but couldn’t find it again.

That image of driving blue highways looking for a remembered home, a
lost home, stuck with me. It’s an image that matches Brown’s dreamy,
memory-scape sound. She said that her father often took them out on
“this sort of southern Iowa circuit,” and she recounted the excitement
of reaching a giant firework stand each time they’d cross the Missouri
border.

Pieta Brown’s childhood, she told us, was full of music. She was often
surrounded by family members playing various instruments---her
grandmother on the pump organ for one---in spontaneous jams. But judging
from her remarks throughout the night, being rooted in song means more
to Brown than having a musical pedigree or serving as a link to Iowa
music royalty. It means a lifelong appreciation for other musicians, and
feeling a sense of musical kinship that is woven into her life as a
songwriter and performer. Throughout the evening, Brown referred to her
work in music, and to life on the tour-road, as one rich with
collaboration, and full of admiration for other artists.

This appreciation and admiration was evident on stage with Bo Ramsey.
Though it was Brown’s name on the ticket, she wanted us to realize that
we were fortunate to be there with Ramsey, whom she described as a
guitarist with “a unique gift.” Brown’s humility and gratitude cohered
into a kind of formality, which Ramsey shared. This formality carried
into their dress and stage presence, which had a sort of country-hip
mystique, but also seemed old school polite—a “thank you for having us
tonight, ma’am” kind of respectfulness. Their mutual attitude was, to
me, one of sincere tribute, to both the night and the work. Brown and
Ramsey created an intimate musical space. They were prepared, but also
improvisational. Ramsey, in his signature cowboy hat and quiet demeanor,
played from a selection of guitars to beautifully crystallize the sense
of yearning and tenderness at the heart of Brown’s songs, and he
complemented Brown’s acoustic strumming with expressive notes and
tremolos. I could see the two actively listening to one another, for one
another, and I did in fact feel fortunate to be there.

“I don’t mind this old world,” Brown said, smiling. The comment
instantly reminded me of the Lucinda Williams song “Sweet Old World”—a
song that, incidentally, Ramsey has played with Williams. But then
during a mischievous pause, before Brown got about as politically
pointed as she would all evening, she said: “It’s easy to mind it a
little bit these days”—some laughter of agreement from the crowd—“but
deep down, I don’t really mind it.”

While most of Brown’s set list dug into her own solo roots---which go
back eight albums to her self-titled release in 2002---she also played
several songs from her March, 2017 album, [*Postcards*](https://lnk.to/postcards). For *Postcards*, Brown had invited
long-distance collaborations with other musicians, people she admired
and sought to work with despite being miles away. Viewing music “as a
collaborative pleasure,” she said that each song on the album had been
co-written across the miles through musical correspondence, or “musical
postcards.” Postcard collaborators include [Calexico](http://www.casadecalexico.com), [Mason Jennings](http://masonjennings.com), The Pines, and [Mark Knopfler](http://www.markknopfler.com) (of Dire
Straits fame), among others.

In performing “Street Tracker,” the song she collaborated on with
Knopfler for *Postcards*, Brown even sought to collaborate with the
audience. She pulled us into participation, not in a raucous call and
response, but into soft echo after each verse. When she prompted, “I
don’t want to,” we sang back, “don’t want to go home.” And we didn’t.
