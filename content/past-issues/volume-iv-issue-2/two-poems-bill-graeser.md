## American Gothic

I stand before you  
a poem etched pitchfork  
in my hand,  

though you offer me yours  
with nothing etched in the handle  
but the wear of work.  

The woman beside you  
wears an expression  
from so long standing beside you,  

and behind you both  
the house.  

Though hay lies in the fields  
I etch another poem in the handle  
like grooves wagons leave in mud,  

or like the house itself  
to those who step inside.

## After the Iowa Caucus

Finally the circus left town...  
with its trapeze acts, its knife  
throwers and clowns,

and the quiet of cornfields  
returned to the town square,  
and to coffee houses

between thoughtfully  
planted rows of conversation

in which we can again agree  
on such matters as topsoil,  
sunshine  
and rain.
