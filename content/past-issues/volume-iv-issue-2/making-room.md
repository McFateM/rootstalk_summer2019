It would be easy  
to make space  
for you in my heart.  
Because,  
as you can see,  
I already have a spare bedroom.  

I must apologize  
for its clutter and mess, 
it hasn’t been used in  
some time  
but it could use a boarder like you.  

Just give me time  
to clean,  
to remove the cobwebs  
and the memorabilia of bygone residents.  

I will warn you,  
there are holes in the walls  
I’ve never been able to fix.  

Maybe you’ll have better luck than I
