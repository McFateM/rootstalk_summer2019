description: "A Georgia poet celebrates the spirits of Spring. "

First breaths of a new life born by a soft breeze of Spring,
why keep them prisoner on the outside when a door is
gaping beyond the hazy boundaries of the manâ€™s soul?
 
A gentle spider tangles, architect of a pearly trap;
soon she will glide into another trestle solid as marble,
viewing the world with a thousand acute senses.
 
It is dark in every atom now, the opening remains,
inviting in, inviting out, communication begins eternal,
with the fresh air of life at the hands of the sweet fairy.
 
Mysterious sighs, murmurs meant to be only secrets,
the creation speaks in formulas, prayers and divine spells,
injecting its eternal and mighty force to every part.
 
Falling leaves dusted in light pollen, caress the nest
of the eloquent nightingale, leaving their signature
in a word majestic, imprinted in every minute detail.
 
Let a draft live as it grows into a hurricane of complex
mechanics, made of infinite waves carrying with them
color, sound, music, gaiety, peace and all anxieties. 
 
Watch the spirits as they giggle to ecstasy with every bump,
and leave the trace of a conversation however brief yet,
which will resonate from now, and simply forevermore.
