Words. Images. Sounds. These are what we at *Rootstalk* share with
you--our readers, our viewers, our listeners. If you have seen only a
hard copy issue of the journal, you have gotten only the writing and the
pictures. When we initially imagined creating *Rootstalk*, we envisioned
it in a conventional print format. Later, we embraced the on-line format
because not only did it allow much less expensive reproduction of
images, especially color images (two dimensional art and photography),
it also allowed us to add sound, including music, birdsong, and
podcasts. True, an on-line presence doesn’t offer the tactile experience
of holding a paper issue in your hands and turning physical pages, but
the sense of touch in that is, frankly, limited.

I suppose the day may come when technology could allow the addition of
the sense of smell to publications like *Rootstalk*: you’ll be able to
see a painting of a flower and be able to smell the flower, or (not as
nice) you’ll read an article about hog confinements and be able to smell
them. This sounds far-fetched, but when I was growing up in Chicago I
went to a friend’s birthday party at which the main entertainment was
going downtown on the “L” to see a movie, “The Scent of Mystery.” What
makes the experience stick in my mind is that the film was shot
(although that’s probably not the right word) in “Smell-o-Vision.”
Little boxes on the back of each seat would, at the appropriate times,
release smells that went along with the action in the film: someone
eating a peach, a man smoking a pipe, and of course a woman wearing
special perfume. (I am not making this up. Google *Smell-o-Vision*.)

And might we someday be able to read in *Rootstalk* about the incessant
winds on the prairie and feel them on our cheek, or see a photograph of
compass plant and be able to touch the screen and feel its sandpapery
leaves? Time will tell. Meanwhile, we hope you enjoy *Rootstalk* using
the three senses it can stimulate. And please, if you have words,
images, or sounds about the prairie region that you would like to share,
consider submitting a piece of content to us. We would like to hear from
you.
