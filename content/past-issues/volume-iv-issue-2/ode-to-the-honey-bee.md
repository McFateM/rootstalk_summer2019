Blessed be  
The honey bee:  
Miniscule  
Cacophony.

Darting ‘bout  
Lazily,  
Carefully,  
The stamen’s jewel.  

Blessed be  
The winged beast  
On tiny joints  
And fuzzy breast.  

Bathing sweet  
In nectar fields,  
Happily  
In apathy.  

Blessed breeze  
That disagrees  
And blows away  
With haste and ease  

The sacred thrum,  
The holy drum,  
Its restlessness  
Impetuous.  

The pitch and yaw  
Of pollen crown:  
A pirouette  
On blossom’s breast.   

Blessed be  
This honey bee:  
The flower’s own  
Soliloquy.
