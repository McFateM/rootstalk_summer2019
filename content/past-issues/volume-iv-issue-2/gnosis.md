Strands of onyx  
Carry the power of Universe expanding  
Telling stories of interconnectedness as it  
Mirrors the night sky  
Created Life  
Motherland Universe  
Tongue-less words  
Starstruck Hearts  
Whetted Thirst  
Deja vu love under the swipe of the Milky Way  
In the sunshine, on the grass  
The flicker of cottonwood leaves overhead  
Covered in raindrops  
Blending your raindance with my sundance  
Southwest Sky  
Woodland Dreams  
Bloodline Streams  
NDN Hands  
Caballo Knees  
It is yours since time began  
Years pass by in each reincarnation  
Until instantly I recognize your spirit  
Souls crisscross millenia, drawing a network into infinity
