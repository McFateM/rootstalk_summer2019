The **American mink** is a semi-aquatic animal endemic throughout much of North America. A member of the *Mustelidae* family, it is related to the otter, badger, marten, weasel, ferret, and wolverine, and like them is an aggressive carnivore, hunting rodents, fish, crustaceans, frogs, and birds. Male minks measure from 13 to 18 inches in body length, and weigh one to three pounds, while females usually measure from 12 to 15 inches and weigh between one and two pounds. The mink’s long streamlined body allows it to enter the burrows of prey and helps to reduce water resistance while it’s swimming.

Though Mustelid species vary greatly in size, minks are typically small animals with short legs, short round ears, and thick fur which tends to be various shades of tawny, from dark to light, with color very evenly distributed over the body and a white chin and lower lip.



**Vocalization:** The American mink has a variety of sounds in its repertoire, including screams, whining peeps, hisses, squeals, grunts, and cries, and even a sort of “quacking bark.”
