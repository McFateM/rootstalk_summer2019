This prairie icon travels under a number of names: the Bison, the
**American Bison**, or (most commonly) the Buffalo. Once, famously, its
herds blackened the Great Plains, sustaining the Plains Indians who
hunted them. During the late 18th century, an estimated 60 million bison
roamed the middle section of North America. Then came America's westward
expansion, and the huge herds were nearly exterminated, dwindling to
less than 550 animals by 1889. Strenuous conservation efforts brought
the bison back from the brink, and the population has rebounded to
roughly a half-million animals.

**Vocalization**: According to the [National Park Service](https://www.nps.gov/articles/bison-bellows-6-23-16.htm), bison make a
variety of sounds. These sounds include anything from the low rumblings
of male bellows sheard during mating season to the high-pitched bleats
of a calf looking for its mother. Other common sounds consist of
"snorts," "coughs," "roars," and "grunts."
