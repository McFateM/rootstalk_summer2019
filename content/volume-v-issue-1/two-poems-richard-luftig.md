### The Notion of North

My parents wished away their lives  
in their winter States over moving south  
to Florida or west to the California coast.  
But I dreamed of north, always north.  
I knew just where I'd go-- North Dakota:  
First to Bowbells then across the border  
at Portal, and on along the railroad  
trunk line to Churchill by Hudson Bay.

Then east across Quebec to Chicoutimi  
where Highway 175 makes a circle  
around the town as if giving travelers  
a chance to escape before overstaying  
their welcome. Towns I'd visit for no other reason  
except for the sounds of their names.  
Places I read from the Texaco roadmaps  
I saved like other kids collected baseball cards:  
Moose Jaw, Flin Flon, Saskatoon, Yellow Knife.

I'd stop in cities I couldn't pronounce  
on a bet: Antigonish, Cocagne,  
Tatamogoosh, Musquodoboit, and of course,  
Middle Musquodoboit. I knew I could  
sow my wild, winter oats in Fertile, Saskatchwan,  
and that they'd have a parade for me in Welcome, Ontario.  
That I'd sit for a while, find my karma in Peace River  
until I finally made it to Paddle Prairie where it stays  
light all night in summer. I'd travel these towns


where rumor has it that ponds freeze  
over in September, where the only two seasons  
are winter and the first of August, where they won't  
let you play hockey unless you speak fluent French.  
A guy once told me it was so boring in Newfoundland  
that the only things to do was drink, watch television and screw  
and I remember thinking: *What else could one want?*

But I never went, never did load up a VW bus,  
catch a Greyhound, take a puddle-jumper  
to Red Deer or Regina, Moncton or Trois Riviers.  
Never made it past Ohio, Indiana, save  
for the occasional foray to Seattle. And now

too old, landlocked in these dreams  
and living in a California desert lost  
among brown, burning hills, I long still  
for northern nights, basso winds tinged  
with frost, fenceposts that dress up on Sundays

in their best winter hats of snow. I watch  
the sky and watch for the chevron flight  
of Canada Geese and listen as they leave faint,  
distant cries of their wish to make it all the way home.

### Winter Games

Another January comes to Iowa.  
But these farms and fields are nobody's  
fool: they give up what little scraps  
of husks and stalks they have left  
after a late fall's harvest to hunker  
down and wait for the first full frost  
of the year. This house, too,  
has been trying to tell me for weeks

with its whistle and its moans  
through spaces that leak  
frigid air that I should have covered  
the porous windows with plastic,  
stuffed foam between the doors  
and floors by now, made sure there's  
oil in the tank in the back yard  
for when the fuel truck can't make it

through because of the iced roads.  
But, like always, I've been a slow learner.  
I've not yet gathered my supply of gossip  
and rumor to sustain me like cords  
of firewood throughout the three,  
no, make that four months that winter  
holds court and announces itself king.  
It won't be until March, before any

any of us hobbles out on our toes  
to avoid the mud, peer straight down  
at our driveways to avoid the black ice  
that wants nothing less than to do us in.  
I'll just have to make it best I can  
with the little I've put away to ride  
the season through: lean in hard  
to the secrets that everyone keeps

but everyone knows, live,  
best I can, to hold on  
until I emerge, see the shadows  
of those who made it into spring  
and take comfort on how  
my neighbors survived  
using my life as kindling  
to stoke their own winter fires.
