**[The Notion of North]{.smallcaps}**

My parents wished away their lives

in their winter States over moving south

to Florida or west to the California coast.

But I dreamed of north, always north.

I knew just where I'd go\-- North Dakota:

First to Bowbells then across the border

at Portal, and on along the railroad

trunk line to Churchill by Hudson Bay.

Then east across Quebec to Chicoutimi

where Highway 175 makes a circle

around the town as if giving travelers

a chance to escape before overstaying

their welcome. Towns I'd visit for no other reason

except for the sounds of their names.

Places I read from the Texaco roadmaps

I saved like other kids collected baseball cards:

Moose Jaw, Flin Flon, Saskatoon, Yellow Knife.

I'd stop in cities I couldn't pronounce

on a bet: Antigonish, Cocagne,

Tatamogoosh, Musquodoboit, and of course,

Middle Musquodoboit. I knew I could

sow my wild, winter oats in Fertile, Saskatchwan,

and that they'd have a parade for me in Welcome, Ontario.

That I'd sit for a while, find my karma in Peace River

until I finally made it to Paddle Prairie where it stays

light all night in summer. I'd travel these towns

where rumor has it that ponds freeze

over in September, where the only two seasons

are winter and the first of August, where they won't

let you play hockey unless you speak fluent French.

A guy once told me it was so boring in Newfoundland

that the only things to do was drink, watch television and screw

and I remember thinking: *What else could one want?*

But I never went, never did load up a VW bus,

catch a Greyhound, take a puddle-jumper

to Red Deer or Regina, Moncton or Trois Riviers.

Never made it past Ohio, Indiana, save

for the occasional foray to Seattle. And now

too old, landlocked in these dreams

and living in a California desert lost

among brown, burning hills, I long still

for northern nights, basso winds tinged

with frost, fenceposts that dress up on Sundays

in their best winter hats of snow. I watch

the sky and watch for the chevron flight

of Canada Geese and listen as they leave faint,

distant cries of their wish to make it all the way home.

**[Winter Games]{.smallcaps}**

Another January comes to Iowa.

But these farms and fields are nobody's

fool: they give up what little scraps

of husks and stalks they have left

after a late fall's harvest to hunker

down and wait for the first full frost

of the year. This house, too,

has been trying to tell me for weeks

with its whistle and its moans

through spaces that leak

frigid air that I should have covered

the porous windows with plastic,

stuffed foam between the doors

and floors by now, made sure there's

oil in the tank in the back yard

for when the fuel truck can't make it

through because of the iced roads.

But, like always, I've been a slow learner.

I've not yet gathered my supply of gossip

and rumor to sustain me like cords

of firewood throughout the three,

no, make that four months that winter

holds court and announces itself king.

It won't be until March, before any

any of us hobbles out on our toes

to avoid the mud, peer straight down

at our driveways to avoid the black ice

that wants nothing less than to do us in.

I'll just have to make it best I can

with the little I've put away to ride

the season through: lean in hard

to the secrets that everyone keeps

but everyone knows, live,

best I can, to hold on

until I emerge, see the shadows

of those who made it into spring

and take comfort on how

my neighbors survived

using my life as kindling

to stoke their own winter fires.
