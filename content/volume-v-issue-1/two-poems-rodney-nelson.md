### Maple Creek Crossing

in winter the horizon would take and hold the eye  
but now in June the fore and middle ground are focal  
and it is not so much the look of the woods around  
the creek as the turning at siesta time to look  
that would have the mind dismounting and reclining on  
the rich kept lawn and open to the recital of  
a mockingbird near the marker  

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;beyond are white smoke  
of ditch fire and brown and tan dust from fieldwork and  
the road but here in immediate heat we read of  
American cavalrymen and trappers that crossed  
and rode on to one more important site or other  
where they would rally to find a pose in history

### A June Weather

in the darkening a straight wind out of southwest got violent on the
prairie, nothing to hinder it  
but a town or grove, and younger trees bent deep, not cracking, losing
no leaf, seemed to be  
joining in, bearing guidons for it, and at the window I read lines in an
old book

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*Men med vildare Stød*  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*falder Stormen paa*

*Frithiofs Saga* by Esaias Tegnér, the Danish translation, a copy
someone had brought along to  
read and reread during settlement of a Dakota of tornado and blizzard,
the language could not go  
on however, would not have done where weather broke into columbarian
serenity and did not  
arise from unquiet sea movement, now the book was mine along with a
memory of one that had  
read aloud, of a voice wanting Frithiof's northern gods to have been, to
ignore the others or none  
directing the wind in this broad wilder place

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;But with wilder Thrusts  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;the Storm comes down
