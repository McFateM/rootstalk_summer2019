### Maple Creek Crossing

in winter the horizon would take and hold the eye

but now in June the fore and middle ground are focal

and it is not so much the look of the woods around

the creek as the turning at siesta time to look

that would have the mind dismounting and reclining on

the rich kept lawn and open to the recital of

a mockingbird near the marker

beyond are white smoke

of ditch fire and brown and tan dust from fieldwork and

the road but here in immediate heat we read of

American cavalrymen and trappers that crossed

and rode on to one more important site or other

where they would rally to find a pose in history

### A June Weather

in the darkening a straight wind out of southwest got violent on the
prairie, nothing to hinder it

but a town or grove, and younger trees bent deep, not cracking, losing
no leaf, seemed to be

joining in, bearing guidons for it, and at the window I read lines in an
old book

*Men med vildare Stød*

*falder Stormen paa*

*Frithiofs Saga* by Esaias Tegnér, the Danish translation, a copy
someone had brought along to

read and reread during settlement of a Dakota of tornado and blizzard,
the language could not go

on however, would not have done where weather broke into columbarian
serenity and did not

arise from unquiet sea movement, now the book was mine along with a
memory of one that had

read aloud, of a voice wanting Frithiof's northern gods to have been, to
ignore the others or none

directing the wind in this broad wilder place

But with wilder Thrusts

the Storm comes down
