The **Virginia opossum**---also known as the North American opossum---is the only marsupial north of Mexico. It’s solitary, nocturnal, about the size of a house cat and all-too-familiar to many homeowners (along with the racoon) as a highly successful raider of garbage cans. 

The opossum has a number of unique physical characteristics. In addition to the brooding pouch it shares in common with other marsupials, it has 50 teeth---more than any other North American land mammal---opposable, clawless thumbs on their rear limbs, and a naked, prehensile tail. The animal is thought to have evolved in South America, but migrated north during the [Great American Interchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_American_Interchange). Until recently, its range extended from Central America to the norther U.S., however climate change appears to be further extending its range into southern Canada.

**Vocalization:** The opossum has a voice appropriate to its retiring nature. Opossums are mostly quiet, but if provoked will hiss or make a grinding cry of warning.
