The white-tailed deer is widespread in the prairie region. It's natural
range stretches from Canada south through the continental U.S., Mexico,
and the countries of Central and South America, down to Peru and
Bolivia. The female---the doe---usually weighs under 100 lbs, but can
range up to nearly 200 lbs. The male---the buck---usually weighs around
100 lbs, though specimens approaching 300 lbs have been known. Bucks are
distinguished also by antlers, which they shed and regrow yearly, and
use to engage other bucks in antler-to-antler pushing contests during
the mating season, usually late October to early November.

On the prairie, the introduction of large-scale agriculture and the
clearcutting of coniferous forests, along with the virtual extirpation
of the white-tail's natural predators, has helped its population to
explode.

**Vocalization**: the white-tail has a repertoire of social grunts and
wheezes, but reserves its loudest sounds for the mating season. During
the rut, males will make a variety of grunts, wheezing snorts and groans
to announce their intentions, corral does, or warn rivals.
