### Rootstalk is an online, multi-media, interdisciplinary journal published in conjunction with the Center for Prairie Studies at Grinnell College and housed on [Digital Grinnell](https://digital.grinnell.edu).  Students, alumni, staff, and faculty of the College have all been involved in creating Rootstalk.

Rootstalk was launched in Spring 2015 as the product of a two-semester course sequence on journal publishing supported by the Wilson Program in Enterprise and Leadership.  A three-year grant from the Collegeâ€™s Innovation Fund will allow us to explore ways to sustain the journal and further discussion about the prairie region.  

Rootstalk publishes original essays, fiction, poetry, visual art, music, and video aimed at a general audience.  We especially hope to publish contributions from people whose views are not normally seen or heard in public forums.

Submit to Rootstalk: Rootstalk welcomes submissions from you or people you know.  Our submission deadline for the Fall 2016 issue is October 15, 2016.  The submission deadline for the Spring 2017 issue is March 15, 2016.  See our Submission Guidelines [here](https://ojs.grinnell.edu/index.php/prairiejournal/about/submissions#onlineSubmissions).
